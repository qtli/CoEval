For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nScoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.\nBake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.\nCool completely before serving.": [
