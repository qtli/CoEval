            "How to play Warhammer 40k, The tabletop game\n\nTo play Warhammer 40k, you will need a few things. First, you will need miniatures of the Warhammer 40k universe. These can be bought pre-painted, or you can paint them yourself. You will also need a playing surface, dice, and some sort of measuring device (either a ruler or a tape measure). Finally, you will need the Warhammer 40k rulebook.\n\nSet up your playing surface. This can be a table, the floor, or even a large piece of cardboard. Place your miniatures on the playing surface. Once all players have their miniatures ready, you will need to agree on who will be the \"attacker\" and who will be the \"defender.\"\n\nThe attacker will take the first turn, and the defender will take the second turn. Players will alternate taking turns until one player either runs out of miniatures, or concedes the game.\n\nOn a player's turn, they will roll dice to see how many \"actions\" they can take. These actions include moving their miniatures around the playing surface and attacking their opponent's miniatures. Attacking is done by rolling dice and comparing the results to the defending player's dice roll. If the attacker's roll is higher, then the defending player's miniature is \"killed\" and removed from the playing surface. The game ends when one player either has no more miniatures, or concedes the game.",
            "Warhammer 40k is a fun game that you play on a big table with little toy soldiers. You and your friends each have your own army of toy soldiers, and you take turns moving them around and trying to make the other person's soldiers go away. It's like playing pretend battles with your toys! You use special dice to see if your soldiers are successful at shooting or fighting in close combat. The person who makes the other person's soldiers all go away first wins!",
            "Alright, here's how it goes:\n\nLikely, once friendly hellos are over, each side will bring over boxes or cases full of little cardboard or plasticard bits of terrain. they will find a nearby battlefield - really, just a big flat modified table thing on which they'll fight - and likely, they'll take turns putting down pieces of terrain until they're sure that it will be a fun match.\n\nAssuming it's a 1 on 1 fight, each side will bring an amount of little dudes and tanks appropriate to the fight they're having. They'll then put these little dudes and tanks on the table. How many guys start on the table, where they start on the table, and when they are allowed to come on is mainly decided by the deployment rules. there are couple of other things, but deployment rules are cricial to players deciding how they will play the game (for example: armies that really like shooting may prefer corner deployments because it dramatically increases the space between them and the other guy). There are also \"missions\" which determine whether the players win by killing the other guy's dudes, or holding ground, or whatever.\n\nIn the actual game, format is usually as follows:\n1. player one moves all his guys\n2. player one shoots\n3. player one \"assaults\" (i.e. has his dudes break out bayonettes and apparantly try to stab the other guy's dudes to death in a complicated hand-to-hand combat. This tends to be very all-or-nothing, and sucess is often decided by your ability to (get into these/avoid these) as much or as little as your army needs it. You **cannot** shoot into assault, so you better hope you can block an assault or that your guys die quickly if your army isn't good enough to just win these outright.\n\nthen player 2 moves, player 2 shoots, player 2 assaults...\n\nThis continues until turn 5, at which point, depending on dice rolls, the game either ends, or gets drag out another turn. on turn 6, they roll again, and either the game ends or it goes to turn 7. Turn 7 is as far as games can go normally. \n\nNow, I'm just trying to give a picture of the general flow of a game, without talking about more complicated ideas like leadership, or mechanization, or why you shouldn't play necrons, lol. \n\nAt the risk of being flamed, I idly suggest you check out [this guy](_URL_0_), as he has a really good grasp of the strategical nuances in the game (although he is something of a dick, or so I am told.)",

            "This is my completely unscientific guess as a medical student- open to corrections!\n\nWhen you stretch, you unconsciously perform something called a 'valsalva manoeuvre' against your epiglottis. This is when you kind of breath out but close your windpipe so that no air can get out. It turns out this has a number of effects, mostly on circulation. Your cardiac output decreases, causing your blood vessels to constrict and your heart to beat faster to bring output back up. This is why after you stretch you sometimes get a brief palpitation.\n\nThe main reason that you might want to perform a valsalva manoeuvre, is that stretching will automatically otherwise expel air in the lungs. Contracting the muscles around you chest squeezes you like a boa constrictor, and unless you put a lid on it, you'll lose the breath you took in.\n\nSo basically, I would say you block your airway to stop you from losing your breath, but you let it trickle out slowly possibly to prevent overtaxing your heart (doesn't make a big difference, but who knows whether it gave our ancestors an advantage). That trickling sounds like a weird stretch gurgle.\n\nEDIT: Or, now that I think of it, it could just be that your unconscious valsalva manoeuvre isn't strong enough to contain the air being expelled by your mighty chest muscles.

            "When we exercise, our body moves and uses energy. Calories are like little pieces of energy that help our body move and do things. Fat is a type of food that can give us lots of energy, but if we eat too much of it, it can make us unhealthy. Our heart beats faster when we exercise because it needs to pump more blood and oxygen to our muscles so they can keep moving.",
            "Your body uses sugar as its main form of energy. Your body gains energy from three main macronutrients: fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. These three can ultimately break down into sugars, or be stored and used for body mass.\n\nCarbohydrates are categorized into digestible and indigestible carbs. The indigestible carbs are fibers (also categorized as a complex carb; but fibers from vegetables mostly). Digestible carbs are complex carbohydrates (bread, wheat, etc) that break down into simple sugars, or simple sugars (plain sugar, fruit sugar, etc) themselves.\n\nFats are categorized as saturated, unsaturated, or trans. Trans take longest to process. Unsaturated take shortest. Saturated is inbetween.\n\nProteins are either used for muscle building or stored in fat for later use.\n\nCarbs are quick source of energy that fills up blood sugar levels. When you exercise, your body taps into blood sugars via glycolysis. When it runs out, you tap into fat reserves under ketosis. When you are at the point of starvation, you undergo catabolysis nd consume muscle tissue.\n\nIncreased heart rate does two things : exercises your heart, and increases your body's metabolism. Increased metabolism just means increased consumption of energy.\n\nWeight loss is simple : Burn more calories than you eat. Exercising makes you gain strength, which allows you to burn calories faster as you get stronger. So a good exercise routine would involve strength training to gain some muscle weight to better lose fat weight.\nYou should eat enough so that you aren't undergoing catabolysis and so that you maintain muscle weight.\nGood rule of thumb : reduce fats, count your carbs and proteins when you work out.\n\n Edit : adding stuff\n\nEdit: fixing semantics",

This is why you can lose weight by eating foods that have a lot of fat in them.\n\nYour heart-rate goes up when you exercise. Exercise makes your heart work harder so that it can pump more blood throughout your body. This increases the number of calories that your body burns.",

She'll stay in the nest box most of the day, and the other hens will slip eggs under her so she'll care for them. When I go to take those eggs, she'll puff her feathers up to look bigger. She might peck at me when I take them. But once I've scooped them out she forgets about them almost instantly and just waits for new eggs to appear. Her instinct seems to be about protecting the space, not counting eggs.\n\nOnce she's sat on them for a week or so, though, she will become aware of their numbers. If I were to slip another egg under her then, she might try to knock it out of the nest.

There are three main ways to store this energy:\n\nInside muscle cells: when you see a bear, he isn't going to give you a 5 minute stretch and 10 minute walking warm up, you gotta run right now. This is only used in emergencies and is incredibly inefficient.\n\nInside the liver: this is your generic energy store, takes a while to get into action, but is very efficient.\n\nInside fat cells: this is a super efficient long term storage that is used very slowly.\n\nWhen you eat food, the energy is allocated in roughly this order: your emergency muscle storage is filled up first, then your liver storage, then your fat cells, then if you have extra, your fat cells will duplicate.\n\nIf you are thinking about diets and losing fat, certain foods (specifically sugar), can very quickly fill up your muscle and liver stores, and also create a situation where there is too much glucose (energy) in your bloodstream. Your muscle cells will reduce their ability to take in glucose to protect themselves, which will make nearly all of your energy enter your fat cells, filling and duplicating them (making more fat). Too much of this leads to fat gain, and possibly diabetes. To reverse this process you have to trick your body into using your emergency muscle stores which will make new energy go to muscles and the liver, instead of straight to fat.\n\nSome ways to do this are:\n\n* Running for your life from a bear.\n\n* Doing high intensity weights\n\n* Sprinting",

            "If there was a fire in the space house, the astronauts would be in big trouble because they can't run away like on Earth. To stop this from happening, they have special rules to follow and things like smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and good ventilation that help keep them safe. They also practice what to do in case of a fire so they know how to stay safe.",
            "If a fire were to break out on a spacecraft in orbit, astronauts would fight the flames in slightly different ways than they would on Earth. Fires in space are not the same as fires on Earth, but the best way to fight any fire is to keep it from starting.\n\nAs hot gasses from a flame rise, they create air currents that bring fresh air to the fire. This buoyancy is what makes a flame long and pointed here on Earth. In low gravity situations, there is no buoyancy from flames.Convection, the movement of air, is an important way that heat is transferred to other spaces. Without air, fires don't spread as rapidly. Ventilation fans on the Space Station replace natural convection and can supply the air a fire needs to burn. Under these circumstances, the fire can spread in any direction, rather than just upward.\n\nThe flame's unusual shape creates different amounts of soot, smoke or harmful gases. \"Combustion in microgravity is a very difficult problem, and there are a lot of engineers and scientists working to understand it better,\" said Gary A. Ruff, aerospace engineer at Glenn Research Center's Microgravity Combustion Science Branch in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nAll materials going up into space are tested for flammability on Earth in a special test chamber and ignited with a hot wire. Some items are so important to a mission's success that they're permitted to travel to space despite being flammable.\n\nDetecting a fire in space is also different than on Earth. Here, smoke detectors are installed on the ceiling or upper section of a wall because that's the direction in which smoke travels. In space, smoke doesn't rise, so detectors on International Space Station are placed within the ventilation system.\nWhile the ISS hasn't experienced a fire, a significant blaze did take place in 1997 on the Russian Space Station Mir. The fire came from an oxygen generator, where the oxygen supplied a ready source of fuel. Tests showed that the generator had to run out of oxygen for the fire to burn out. If a fire were to occur on the ISS, the astronauts would become firemen and follow a three-step response system.\n\nFirst, they would turn off the ventilation system to slow the spread of fire. Next they would shut off power to the effected unit. Finally astronauts would use fire extinguishers to put out the flames.\n\nRuff says that while safeguards have been in place to prevent a fire from occurring on the Space Station, it's comforting to know that astronauts could respond to an emergency because they've prepared for any eventuality.",
            "The International Space Station (ISS) is a place where astronauts live and work. It's in space, so if there was a fire on the ISS, it would be really hard to put out. The ISS is kept cool by a series of fans and radiators. If something were to catch on fire, the fans would start to spin faster and the radiators would heat up, which would put out the fire.",

Lets presume you live to be 80 years old and we start this at the age of 20.\n\nThat is sixty years of life you gotta cover.\n\nShort answer would be around 1,000,000 dollars if you live in the USA\nSimply by living off the interest of this amount sitting in a bank would allow you to afford a very meager lifestyle, and towards the end of your life you could cash it in and spend the rest of it. Invested properly this could get you from 10,000 a year to 50,000 (the latter involving dividends and the prior sticking it into a savings account)\n\nYou have no assets, no car, no home, nothing. Starting here we need to understand what you want out of life. To simply survive, you only need around what food costs you a year, but then you'll be homeless- and probably won't make it to 80.\n\nTo have a property- depends greatly on where you live, but you need to pay an upkeep to keep your property (Taxes, fixing problems, replacing broken things) so we can take a stab at this- or you can go the route of renting which will be \"Cheaper\" but you will never be able to get the money back, where by owning a property eventually you pay it off and can resell it if you desire.\n\nThe reason people like to own a property is because as long as the value remains steady it essentially costs you \"Nothing\" outside of taxes/upkeep. If you live in it for 20 years and sell it for what you bought it for, you just lived in a house for \"Free\" \n\nWe will call the property 150,000 + 200,000 in costs over your life if you don't sell it and live there all 60 years. This is a tiny house for one person. If you live in NY, I'm sorry but the 200,000 just turned into 600,000 but lets just pray you don't.\n\nCost of living, in the USA you need a car unless you live in a city- but lets pray you don't because cities are stupid expensive. Car lasts 10 years (rough estimate) costs 20,000. 20,000 x 6 = 120,000\n\nUpkeep on car + Gas + Costs of living = 10,000 a year as long as you don't travel much/keep the car in good condition/don't eat out every day\n\nTOTAL IT OUT: \n\n* Small cheap home/costs of renting for 60 years: 350,000 $ (If you buy, you can get a lot of this back when you decide to sell and move which makes this an interesting category as the house can essentially cost you nothing, and just act as a bank account you can't touch until you move.)\n\n* Costs of cars at a 10 year life span: 120,000 $\n\n* Costs of living/utilities/insurance over 60 years: 600,000 $\n\n* Extra stuff/things I've missed: 100,000 $\n\nThis is not counting the money you will make off of interest, and state by state the taxes will be different so the costs of living could fluctuate dramatically depending.\n\nIf you took this as a magical lump some in a savings account and somehow avoided getting the shit taxed out of it you could live off the interest and be extremely poor- or invest it and live well enough off of dividends. This is a difficult question to answer due to the fact that currency- especially the dollar, might not hold over the next 60 years.

The sentence \"Organic foods are usually more expensive to give the farmer an incentive to produce those and not use pesticides which increase yields\" provides some information on why organic foods are more expensive. Finally, the sentence \"If this isn't specific enough I could easily go into more detail\" shows that the answerer is willing to provide more information if needed.",
                "1. The answer candidate does satisfy the premise as it attempts to provide a helpful explanation for why healthy foods are more expensive than processed foods.\n\n2.

I would assign a score of 4 to this answer based on the premise. While the answer does provide helpful information, it may not be completely comprehensible to a five-year-old due to the use of legal terms such as \"estate\" and \"heirs\". \n\n3.

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.",
