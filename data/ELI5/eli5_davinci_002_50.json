        "prediction": "There could be a few reasons why it seems like you do not dream, or why you forget your dreams easily. One reason might be that you are not getting enough sleep, and so your brain is not getting enough time to process information and create dreams. Another reason might be that you have a condition called sleep apnea, which means that you stop breathing for short periods of time during the night, which can disrupt your sleep and make it difficult to dream. Finally, some people simply don't remember their dreams because they don't pay attention to them. Dreams can be strange and hard to understand, so it's normal to forget them soon after waking up."

        "prediction": "How to play Warhammer 40k, The tabletop game\n\nTo play Warhammer 40k, you will need a few things. First, you will need miniatures of the Warhammer 40k universe. These can be bought pre-painted, or you can paint them yourself. You will also need a playing surface, dice, and some sort of measuring device (either a ruler or a tape measure). Finally, you will need the Warhammer 40k rulebook.\n\nSet up your playing surface. This can be a table, the floor, or even a large piece of cardboard. Place your miniatures on the playing surface. Once all players have their miniatures ready, you will need to agree on who will be the \"attacker\" and who will be the \"defender.\"\n\nThe attacker will take the first turn, and the defender will take the second turn. Players will alternate taking turns until one player either runs out of miniatures, or concedes the game.\n\nOn a player's turn, they will roll dice to see how many \"actions\" they can take. These actions include moving their miniatures around the playing surface and attacking their opponent's miniatures. Attacking is done by rolling dice and comparing the results to the defending player's dice roll. If the attacker's roll is higher, then the defending player's miniature is \"killed\" and removed from the playing surface. The game ends when one player either has no more miniatures, or concedes the game."

This is because of the historical precedent set by previous generations of workers; men have typically been paid more than women for the same job. Therefore, companies believe that they can get away with paying women less, because they think that women will accept lower wages. Additionally, there are often fewer women than men who are qualified for certain jobs, so companies may feel like they have to pay men more in order to attract and retain the best employees."
