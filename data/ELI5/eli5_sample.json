        "output": [
            "As time goes on, the demands of the internet will increase.  Pictures and videos will be higher resolution.  Sites will have a greater number of scripts.  The whole experience will be \"richer\".  Reddit itself will probably not change much, as it's an aggregation of content from elsewhere, but all those sites that are linked are going to need more bandwidth.\n\nIn order to cope with the increased demands, ISPs will be prompted to improve their service.  However... they don't NEED to.  Their audience needs their product and there isn't another option outside the big boys.  So what they'll likely do is increase the service *for those who pay for preferential treatment*.  That means links to big sites like the news outlets will keep up with the demands of the internet, while imgur and similar hosting sites will need to pony up the cash if they don't want to be left in the (relatively) dark ages of data transfer.",
            "First, realize that reddit doesn't make much (if any) profit.  They don't have money to throw around.  And the end of Net Neutrality means the end of any site that can't afford the \"fast lane\".\n\nI'm sure you've seen the reddit \"hug of death\" in action before.  This happens when a *single article* no reddit causes a huge amount of traffic to hit an unsuspecting corner of the internet.  And this happens *without any limiting factors from ISPs*.  Without Net Neutrality, Reddit itself would be under a constant hug of death.  It simply wouldn't function.\n\nBut let's assume some company comes along and buys reddit and tries to turn it into a profitable site.  We'd see a ton more advertising on reddit all of a sudden, and most likely our comment/browsing history on the site would be monitored and sold, similar to how facebook works currently.  \n\nHowever, even after making it profitable, reddit wouldn't be what it once was.  Instead of being a dumping ground for anything of interest that anyone might want to contribute, it would be the internet version of the [cable channel guide](_URL_0_):  A place to see what the major media outlets want you to be watching, but not a place where you can see what your neighbor's cat got into last night.",
            "I'm by no means an expert, but I see things headed back towards the days of cable. I think ISPs want to be able to separate the internet into nice clean packages of \"channels\" sorted by popularity, each of which you can opt into for a price. If you're old enough, you may remember the [channeled interface of early AOL](_URL_1_).",
            "Reddit would become 'Reddit: Extreme Death Hug Edition.'\n\nLinks to major outlets would still work fine as those major outlets would be forking over money to the gatekeepers of bandwidth (ISPs). Everything else would be stuck at the current state of internet speed or worse. A link to some little blogger or photojournalist would take forever. Eventually most of the major outlets would start throwing up their own paywalls to access their links. Have a dissenting opinion about Comcast and you'd like to link to an article about it? You can do that, but it will take so long to load that article that nobody will read it.\n\nTo put this in perspective, if this had happened in the 90's, today you'd be able to watch HD streaming video on AOL by paying for AOL's \"Advanced Everything Plan!\" but anywhere else you went, a picture would still take 40 seconds to load. No YouTube. No Facebook. No Google maps. The internet would be whatever the board of AOL and it's chosen ISP decided they wanted to use it for to get you to pay more.\n\nOh, and all that free porn from all those subreddits on your 'special' account? Gone. Gone like a bangbus after it drops off a post coital hottie at a random street corner in Miami.",
            "Let me start by defining Net Neutrality:\nNet Neutrality is the concept that all traffic on the internet is allowed to move and transfer irrelevant of the content it carries, the source it comes from and its destination.\n\nPeople in favour of Net Neutrality include Consumer Groups (who makes use of services, like us), content providers (e.g. youtube) and Internet Founders, because removing Net Neutrality defies the original purpose of the internet, as a sovereign place that is immune from regulations imposed by the real world regulators.\n\nPeople against it includes Many ISPs, Telecoms and network operators.\n\nThe internet is a network of networks.  Controlling the free transfer of data between these networks with equal bandwidth, irrelevant of the type of information being transferred, would be the end of Net Neutrality.\n\nThey want to change the current situation with the claim that it will become more just, because the right amount of bandwidth will be given to who really needs it, and to the information that has the most priority.  In other words, give the bandwidth to who is ready to pay.  They also claim that this extra profit with help them improve the infrastructure, which everyone will benefit from in the end.\n\nISPs that are an all-rounded company offering other services such as telephony, would start to degrade the bandwidth for VoIP services such as Skype, so that consumers will find the service bad and turn to their telephony services to make calls instead.  The Dutch Parliament for example passed a law stopping mobile operators from blocking or charging extra for voice calling done via the net.\n\nISPs and companies that offer online services, will be able to come with agreements, where ISPs can have exclusive access to certain sites, and you would have to buy services from the ISP in order to be able to use those sites.\n\nAlso, ISPs will start to charge companies to make their bandwidth good enough to be enjoyable by their customers/consumers.  Big, already stable, companies, can afford to pay and stay on top.  But non-profit, and start-up companies will find it almost impossible to even start anywhere near entering the market of the big ones.  They will not have the financial power to offer the same level of service as the ones already there.  \n\nTill now, the internet has been a very good tool to reduce monopolies, and to help new start-ups and inventions flourish from nothing.  This is possible because the internet removes the need for middle man and intermediaries.  Before the internet, you had no other option, but to go to a publish to publish your book, sell to a shop if you want to market your product, etc...  All that, at this point in time, can be easily replaced by the internet.\n\nIn the end of all this, you as a consumer would end up paying more to get the same level of service.  ISPs will charge you for special access, and your Online Services will charge you more because they need to cover their cost being charged by the ISPs as well.\n\nSomeone else in a comment explained as well that sites such as Reddit, with minimal profit, won't be able to pay extra for such bandwidth, and hence they will not be able to handle the load of visitors that some posts tend to attract.\n\nMany countries have been debating laws to preserve net neutrality.  Back in 2011,  Chile and the Netherlands were the first to put the Net Neutrality concept into their National Law.\n\nHope this puts you more in the picture of how the removal of Net Neutrality can effect organisations as well as end consumers.",
            "We'll make our own internet.... with bandwidth.. and encryption.",
            "When people talk about Net Neutrality, many seem to think it's either \"all service is equal\" or \"only a few rich sites/apps/etc. get fast service and everything else sucks.\" In reality, each Internet Service Provider (ISP) would treat  \"non-Net Neutrality\" differently as regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nThe new FCC ruling has been getting a lot of attention recently, but it isn't entirely clear what all it will allow ISPs to do. The deal between Netflix and Comcast (to provide better service to Netflix customers) has been allowed to proceed. But it also increases some disclosure requirements about Internet speed. So we don't have a Net Neutrality-free Internet at this point. I thought [this article](_URL_2_) articulated the issues pretty well.\n\nAnd I feel it's important to mention, while \"non-Net Neutraliy\" gets a lot of bad attention on reddit, it could have some very positive consequences. For example, there are many talented doctors who perform \"tele-surgery\" and require very fast Internet speeds to conduct safe and exact operations. Limiting the speeds those surgeons could use would damage their ability to help patients.\n\nIn short, moving away from a net neutral Internet policy would open up a lot of different possibilities (some you may like, some you may not like). In other words, no one really knows for sure what exactly would happen - it would probably have a lot of different consequences that are difficult or impossible to predict.",
            "When you scroll down the page and all the links are purple and you desperately look for more links to turn purple and you can. Eventually more and more of the links will stay blue because the website that is linked is throttled by the ISPs and your ability to get on to them is hindered, most likely causing you to give up because you aren't, and shouldn't really be, willing to wait minutes for pages to load. The cost to keep sites like Reddit being throttled down is on the rise. Politics corrupts the ISPs. Money changes hands and suddenly Reddit is unable to pay to keep themselves online. The number of people trying to access the site is too much for the bandwidth Reddit is allocated. Reddit crashes and they are forced to limit the number of people allowed on the site.",
            "at first? probably nothing. the amount of \"data\" reddit uses and the amount of \"money\" reddit commands is simply \"0\" compared to the likes of google and netflix.\n\nat first nothing would happen to normal \"websites\" since those websites are not a threat to incumbents. ie the ISP's\n\nnow later down the road. if this stuff comes to be and its not defeated I could absolutely see politicians sliding a little cash into ISP hands to make an \"unwanted\" website a little harder to get to.\n\nthe attention span of people is quite small on the internet. a delay of a few second would be enough to make most go somewhere else.\n\nbut that would be 10 or 20 years down the road.",

They'll then put these little dudes and tanks on the table. How many guys start on the table, where they start on the table, and when they are allowed to come on is mainly decided by the deployment rules. there are couple of other things, but deployment rules are cricial to players deciding how they will play the game (for example: armies that really like shooting may prefer corner deployments because it dramatically increases the space between them and the other guy). There are also \"missions\" which determine whether the players win by killing the other guy's dudes, or holding ground, or whatever.\n\nIn the actual game, format is usually as follows:\n1. player one moves all his guys\n2. player one shoots\n3. player one \"assaults\" (i.e. has his dudes break out bayonettes and apparantly try to stab the other guy's dudes to death in a complicated hand-to-hand combat. This tends to be very all-or-nothing, and sucess is often decided by your ability to (get into these/avoid these) as much or as little as your army needs it. You **cannot** shoot into assault, so you better hope you can block an assault or that your guys die quickly if your army isn't good enough to just win these outright.\n\nthen player 2 moves, player 2 shoots, player 2 assaults...\n\nThis continues until turn 5, at which point, depending on dice rolls, the game either ends, or gets drag out another turn. on turn 6, they roll again, and either the game ends or it goes to turn 7. Turn 7 is as far as games can go normally. \n\nNow, I'm just trying to give a picture of the general flow of a game, without talking about more complicated ideas like leadership, or mechanization, or why you shouldn't play necrons, lol. \n\nAt the risk of being flamed, I idly suggest you check out [this guy](_URL_0_), as he has a really good grasp of the strategical nuances in the game (although he is something of a dick, or so I am told.)"

            "This is my completely unscientific guess as a medical student- open to corrections!\n\nWhen you stretch, you unconsciously perform something called a 'valsalva manoeuvre' against your epiglottis. This is when you kind of breath out but close your windpipe so that no air can get out. It turns out this has a number of effects, mostly on circulation. Your cardiac output decreases, causing your blood vessels to constrict and your heart to beat faster to bring output back up. This is why after you stretch you sometimes get a brief palpitation.\n\nThe main reason that you might want to perform a valsalva manoeuvre, is that stretching will automatically otherwise expel air in the lungs. Contracting the muscles around you chest squeezes you like a boa constrictor, and unless you put a lid on it, you'll lose the breath you took in.\n\nSo basically, I would say you block your airway to stop you from losing your breath, but you let it trickle out slowly possibly to prevent overtaxing your heart (doesn't make a big difference, but who knows whether it gave our ancestors an advantage). That trickling sounds like a weird stretch gurgle.\n\nEDIT: Or, now that I think of it, it could just be that your unconscious valsalva manoeuvre isn't strong enough to contain the air being expelled by your mighty chest muscles.

            "Your body uses sugar as its main form of energy. Your body gains energy from three main macronutrients: fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. These three can ultimately break down into sugars, or be stored and used for body mass.\n\nCarbohydrates are categorized into digestible and indigestible carbs. The indigestible carbs are fibers (also categorized as a complex carb; but fibers from vegetables mostly). Digestible carbs are complex carbohydrates (bread, wheat, etc) that break down into simple sugars, or simple sugars (plain sugar, fruit sugar, etc) themselves.\n\nFats are categorized as saturated, unsaturated, or trans. Trans take longest to process. Unsaturated take shortest. Saturated is inbetween.\n\nProteins are either used for muscle building or stored in fat for later use.\n\nCarbs are quick source of energy that fills up blood sugar levels. When you exercise, your body taps into blood sugars via glycolysis. When it runs out, you tap into fat reserves under ketosis. When you are at the point of starvation, you undergo catabolysis nd consume muscle tissue.\n\nIncreased heart rate does two things : exercises your heart, and increases your body's metabolism. Increased metabolism just means increased consumption of energy.\n\nWeight loss is simple : Burn more calories than you eat. Exercising makes you gain strength, which allows you to burn calories faster as you get stronger. So a good exercise routine would involve strength training to gain some muscle weight to better lose fat weight.\nYou should eat enough so that you aren't undergoing catabolysis and so that you maintain muscle weight.\nGood rule of thumb : reduce fats, count your carbs and proteins when you work out.\n\n Edit : adding stuff\n\nEdit: fixing semantics",
            "Here's one aspect of it.  When you breathe in oxygen, it gets used in a chemical reaction to release energy for your body to do stuff. Every pair of oxygen atoms that gets used in that reaction bonds with a carbon atom to create carbon dioxide, which you then exhale. \n\nSo you breathe in a pair of oxygen atoms, then exhale a pair of oxygen atoms *plus* a carbon atom. That's how you lose weight by exercising. It makes you breathe harder, which means you're exhaling more carbon dioxide, which weighs more than the oxygen than the oxygen you consumed to create it.\n\nAnd if you want numbers:\n\nTwo oxygen atoms together have a mass of 16 atomic mass units. A carbon atom has a mass of 6 units. So the gas you exhale weighs in the neighborhood of one third more than the gas you inhale.\n\n6/16 = 37.5% which is a little bigger than 33.3%, or 1/3\n\nOr you can look at it like I did the mental math. 6 is close to 5, and 16 is close to 15, so 6/16 is going to be similar to 5/15, which reduces to 1/3."

And outside of Spain and France, you'll meet very few speakers. \n\nAs for the difference between Spain and Latin America, I'm told by friends that it's sort of like going from New York to Glasgow.  It takes some getting used to the very different accents, but you can easily make yourself understood even if you sometimes misunderstand things to comic effect.",
            "Maybe you're confusing catalan with castillian, which is the \"spanish version\" we speak in Latin america. \n\nThe difference between LA spanish and Spain's spanish would be similar to british and NA english. The words are the same, some spelled differently, and some developed other meanings (culture related, ie, calling someone a flower bulb in Latin America will get you weird looks, while doing it in spain will get you in hospital.). The most noticeable difference is, of course, accents.\n\nFor what little I know of catalan, its a weird mix of spanish/english/german/italian words all put in together and, as stated before, only a small portion of spain speaks catalan.",
            "First of all, it's useful to make a *three* way distinction here between these:\n\n1. Northern Spain\n2. Southern Spain\n3. New World (which includes not just the Americas, but the Canary Islands as well).\n\nNew World Spanish originated from some of the southern dialects in Spain, with perhaps the speech of Seville as the most influential.\n\nNow, the biggest three differences are the following.\n\nFirst, northern Spain has the *s*/*z* distinction (called *distinci\u00f3n* in Spanish); *caza* (\"hunting\") and *casa* (\"house\") are different words with different pronunciations.  In southern Spain and the New World, those are always pronounced the same (and you often get different words to disambiguate them: *cacer\u00eda* \"hunting\").  In the New World all of these are pronounced with an *s* sound, and the phenomenon is called *seseo*.  In southern Spain you mostly also get seseo, but there are a few regions where they pronounce all these words with a *z* sound; this is called *ceceo*.\n\nSecond, in northern and southern Spain most dialects have the *vosotros*/*vosotras* second person plural pronouns and conjugations, whereas in the New World these only exist in grammar books.\n\nThird, the way the letter *j* is pronounced varies between northern Spain and the New World; the New World pronunciation is like an English *h* (in words like *house*), whereas the northern Spain pronunciation is a [voiceless velar fricative](_URL_0_) (like the pronunciation of *ch* in *Bach* in German).  (I don't remember what sound they use in Southern Spain.)\n\nThose are really the three big dialectal differences in Spanish that more or less align with Spain vs. Latin America.  There are other dialect differences, but those others tend to be things that exist both in Spain and America, or that are restricted to regions of one of them.\n\nFor example, one of the big differences between Spanish dialects is how to pronounce *s* at the ends of syllables or words.  Some dialects pronounce them like the *s* sounds, and others tend to turn it into an aspiration (like the letter *h* in English) or drop them.  So take the phrase *todos los cisnes son blancos*; in some regions they pronounce this with all of the *s* sounds, and in others they often pronounce it like  \"todoh loh cihneh son blancoh.\"\n\nBut that's not a Spain-vs-New World difference, because: (a) northern Spain and some parts of Latin America (e.g., Mexico City) pronounce all the *s*'s; (b) central Spain (e.g., parts of Madrid), southern Spain and parts of Latin America (e.g., Argentina) drop them.  (To make it even more complicated, the boundary in Spain isn't the same as the *s*/*z* boundary; parts of Madrid have the *s*/*z* distinction *and* will drop *s* at the ends of syllables.)\n\nAnother one is that many dialects in Latin America has a second person singular pronoun *vos*, either as a replacement for *t\u00fa* or in addition to it.  But that's not universal in Latin America either, so it really is a peculiarity of those dialects.",
            "Catalan is only widely spoken in Catalonia, which is a region of north-east Spain of which the main city is Barcelona. It is a Spanish language in the sense that it comes from Spain but the language that is usually called \"Spanish\" is actually Castilian, from Castile (the central parts of Spain including Madrid). In Catalonia you will find things like bi-lingual road signs but everyone will understand Castilian. They hold on to Catalan for the sense of regional identity, especially since Spanish regionalism was forcibly repressed after their civil war.\n\nThere are other regional languages in Spain, such as Basque, as there are in most countries such as Occitan in France or Cornish in England. These languages predate the modern boundaries of the European nations, in fact they predate the modern sense of a nation state. In Spain it was the people of Castile that unified the other regions into modern Spain so their particular language became \"Spanish.\"\n\nIf you want to visit Spain and speak their language you should learn Castilian, aka normal Spanish. This is the language that was exported by the Spanish to South America and will be spoken by Spanish speakers there, albeit with their own accents and dialects. Of course for the more casual/lazy tourist most Spaniards will know English these days too, at least if they are in the tourism industry in any way."

So it is a fraction.  If it is  & lt; 1, the measured entity is less than the standard, and so forth.  \n  \nBecause of the large differences in numbers (a millionth or a million times), it is expressed as a power of 10.  For example if something is a million times as powerful than the standard, it is 6 Bels, or 60 deci-Bels.  \n  \nSo if you have something smaller than the standard, the number is a negative power of 10.  Something a millionth of the standard would be -6 Bels, or -60 dB.  \n  \nSo, in electronics, where we want to measure how much noise is on a line compared to how much signal, you might see something on the order of -80 dB.  \n  \nIf you are measuring power, you will see -3 dB a lot, because it is half the power.  Log10(0.5) * 10 = approx -3.    \n  \nOne thing dB is used for is measuring sound pressure.  We base our sound pressure measurements on the minimum level of human perception of basically a mosquito 3m away, if you haven't been to too many rock concerts.  However, acoustic power varies by the ratio of the *square* of the pressure measurements, basically doubling the dB.",
            "Decibels (dB) are a logarithmic unit that provides a scale for measuring the power in the signal arriving at your phone.  The number of decibels is ten times the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio of two power quantities. The reference, is probably the transmit power, so 0 would represent a receive signal the same power as the transmit one.  Generally, the negative numbers tell you that the receive power is less, that's what one might expect since you're far from the cell phone tower.  The closer to 0, the higher the power."

            "The answer is they don't and I'll try to explain it as eli5 as possible.\n\n Imagine there are 10 people in your kindergarten class (5 boys and 5 girls) and the teacher gives out fancy colored pencils as rewards for doing extra assignments. Out of the 5 girls, there is one girl, Suzy, that really really loves those pencils so she works really hard to earn them. By the end of the year, she has earned the most out of the whole class with 20 pencils. But the rest of the girls tend to be more interested in playing with their toys, and the other children and they all each only earn 5 pencils throughout the year. So in total, all of the girls earned 40 pencils combined, or an average of 8 pencils per girl. Now, looking at the boys, there are two boys, Johnny and Billy, that really like the pencils because the teacher has some cool super hero ones this year so they work hard to get as many as they can. Johnny gets 18 and Billy gets 17. Then the rest of the boys were more interested in playing with toys and the other children so they each only earn 5 pencils. So for the boys, all together they earned 50 pencils, or an average of 10 pencils per boy.\n\nAnd that is how the \"women make 70 cents on the dollar compared to men\" statistic was calculated. Industrious little Suzy didn't work really hard and only earn 8 pencils, she got what she worked for and earned the most out of the whole class, just like Johnny and Billy worked hard and were rewarded for that hard work. It just so happens that in this particular kindergarten class, there were more girls who were uninterested in earning pencils than there were boys. So the average is due to the choices made by group in general, not because the teacher favored the boys and made the girls work harder for each pencil. Applying this to the real world, there are obviously really successful women like Suzy who earn what they deserve for the work they are doing just the same as men. But even today, women are much more likely to make the choice to stay home with children, work part time to focus on family, go into fields which are maybe more \"emotionally fulfilling\" but pay less, while men tend to stay in the work force longer, work full time even when starting a family, and go into careers that may be less \"emotionally fulfilling\" but have a higher salary.\n\n**tl;dr:** Add up every dollar a woman earned in the US, then add up every dollar a man earned. The women's sum will be less than the men's sum, but that's because less women work and work in high paying positions, not because of sexism.",

            "\"Women receive less than men for the same job\" is more of a half truth. \n\nThere are several factors you need to consider would looking at the gender wage gap. \n\n1. Occupational distributions \n\nOn average men make X and women make less than X. Vast majority of this difference is due to difference of job choice. How many women are nurses and secretaries vs lawyers and doctors?\n\nHowever this only helps explain the gender wage gap but not the actual reason why men make more than women.\n\n2. Group behavior.\n\nTypically, men have a more aggressive attitude with jobs. On the whole men will apply to almost any job that they might think they can do regardless of qualifications and more likely to negotiate a higher wage. Women are more on the opposite end of the  spectrum. \nMore likely to only apply to jobs they feel they have qualifications for and more likely to settle for offered wages.\n\nAccounts for minor differences\n\n3. Company-Employee relations \n\nMost important part of determining wages though is your training and qualifications. The issue here is that there is a cyclic stereotype against women being that since women are more likely to leave their jobs the company should not put time into training women. It's cyclic because since women are not likely to be trained and not earn higher wages, they are more likely to leave... Men are more likely to be fast tracked and train on company specific and desired skills leading to hire wages in same job. This is a form of statisical discrimination that companies get away with.\n\nBasically need to look behind factors of the wage gap. Men can make more for the same job over women. It's not illegal just because they make more. \n\nMaybe they got a raise for mertitorious work, maybe they have certain skills in that lead to higher wages, maybe they have more experience or seniority. Therefore just hiring more women does not solve anything as they would eventually have to pay them more as they accrue skills and qualifications same as men.\n\nHowever, and here's the big one. Women should not make less then men if they are similarly qualified. If they do make less simply because they are women, that is gender discrimination and that is the illegal part. It still happens today, and it's very hard to catch when it does take place.",

            "So for water to turn from liquid to gas it needs to be at a certain temperature (usually 100C) and then it needs to absorb enough energy to transition from liquid to gas, this is called Latent Engergy of Vaporization. This is why water \"boils\", because the pot of water may be at 100C but as some of the water absorbs enough energy to turn to gas it bubbles up through the rest of the water. The amount of energy for water at 100C to turn from liquid to gas is about 100 time more energy than to heat the water from room temperature to 100C. This is why only small parts of the water turn into gas at a time.\n\nYou can \"flash boil\" water, where it would all vaporize at once. To do this you would have to heat the water under enough pressure to raise the boiling point high enough that you could get enough energy into the water that once the pressure is released and the boiling point drops it all instantly boils. Though this would be extremely dangerous, because that would essentially be a bomb.\n\nA better example is \"flash freezing\".

Think about it, when you boil water you are putting energy into it the whole time but once it reaches 212 degrees it isn't getting hotter. Where is the energy going? State change.

            "> Can a quantum computer solve problems that would be impossible to solve using regular computing; or human thought?\n\nQuantum computers would be used to solve a very narrow specific set of problems.  It is not likely they would be used for most computer problems.  Transistor based computers will likely still do those things faster.  \n\nHere's an example of this narrow focus.  Integer factorization.  For example, take two very large prime numbers (dozens and dozens of digits each).  Now multiply them together.  Now throw away the original primes.  The question becomes, can you figure out what those two original primes were?\n\nFor humans, this would take universe lifetimes.  For current transistor based computers, this would also take universe lifetimes (well, this hasn't been proved, but it's likely to be the case).  For quantum computers, they could produce a result in minutes.  \n\nHowever, there are only a handful of important problems that quantum computers could solve which regular transistor computers could not.  This part is hard to describe, but I'll try to simplify it.   You can think of all types of problems to be solved with algorithms/computers into four categories.  P, NP, NP-Complete, and NP-Hard.  Current computers are meant to solve the first category, the P problems.  Sometimes we need to have more computers or faster computers to solve more of these P problems, but the idea is that P problems are the kinds of problems we can conceivably do.  The others, NP, NP-Complete, NP-Hard aren't really computable in universe lifetimes when the problems get bigger.  \n\nHere's where quantum computers come in.  They can solve *some* NP problems.  Not all NP problems, but some.  Unfortunately they can't help us with the NP-Complete or NP-Hard problems.  And P problems are still best done with current computers.  So quantum computers will be best used only for a few problems.",

This is only used in emergencies and is incredibly inefficient.\n\nInside the liver: this is your generic energy store, takes a while to get into action, but is very efficient.\n\nInside fat cells: this is a super efficient long term storage that is used very slowly.\n\nWhen you eat food, the energy is allocated in roughly this order: your emergency muscle storage is filled up first, then your liver storage, then your fat cells, then if you have extra, your fat cells will duplicate.\n\nIf you are thinking about diets and losing fat, certain foods (specifically sugar), can very quickly fill up your muscle and liver stores, and also create a situation where there is too much glucose (energy) in your bloodstream. Your muscle cells will reduce their ability to take in glucose to protect themselves, which will make nearly all of your energy enter your fat cells, filling and duplicating them (making more fat).

            "If a fire were to break out on a spacecraft in orbit, astronauts would fight the flames in slightly different ways than they would on Earth. Fires in space are not the same as fires on Earth, but the best way to fight any fire is to keep it from starting.\n\nAs hot gasses from a flame rise, they create air currents that bring fresh air to the fire. This buoyancy is what makes a flame long and pointed here on Earth. In low gravity situations, there is no buoyancy from flames.Convection, the movement of air, is an important way that heat is transferred to other spaces. Without air, fires don't spread as rapidly. Ventilation fans on the Space Station replace natural convection and can supply the air a fire needs to burn. Under these circumstances, the fire can spread in any direction, rather than just upward.\n\nThe flame's unusual shape creates different amounts of soot, smoke or harmful gases. \"Combustion in microgravity is a very difficult problem, and there are a lot of engineers and scientists working to understand it better,\" said Gary A. Ruff, aerospace engineer at Glenn Research Center's Microgravity Combustion Science Branch in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nAll materials going up into space are tested for flammability on Earth in a special test chamber and ignited with a hot wire. Some items are so important to a mission's success that they're permitted to travel to space despite being flammable.\n\nDetecting a fire in space is also different than on Earth. Here, smoke detectors are installed on the ceiling or upper section of a wall because that's the direction in which smoke travels. In space, smoke doesn't rise, so detectors on International Space Station are placed within the ventilation system.\nWhile the ISS hasn't experienced a fire, a significant blaze did take place in 1997 on the Russian Space Station Mir. The fire came from an oxygen generator, where the oxygen supplied a ready source of fuel. Tests showed that the generator had to run out of oxygen for the fire to burn out. If a fire were to occur on the ISS, the astronauts would become firemen and follow a three-step response system.\n\nFirst, they would turn off the ventilation system to slow the spread of fire. Next they would shut off power to the effected unit. Finally astronauts would use fire extinguishers to put out the flames.\n\nRuff says that while safeguards have been in place to prevent a fire from occurring on the Space Station, it's comforting to know that astronauts could respond to an emergency because they've prepared for any eventuality."

Lets presume you live to be 80 years old and we start this at the age of 20.\n\nThat is sixty years of life you gotta cover.\n\nShort answer would be around 1,000,000 dollars if you live in the USA\nSimply by living off the interest of this amount sitting in a bank would allow you to afford a very meager lifestyle, and towards the end of your life you could cash it in and spend the rest of it. Invested properly this could get you from 10,000 a year to 50,000 (the latter involving dividends and the prior sticking it into a savings account)\n\nYou have no assets, no car, no home, nothing. Starting here we need to understand what you want out of life. To simply survive, you only need around what food costs you a year, but then you'll be homeless- and probably won't make it to 80.\n\nTo have a property- depends greatly on where you live, but you need to pay an upkeep to keep your property (Taxes, fixing problems, replacing broken things) so we can take a stab at this- or you can go the route of renting which will be \"Cheaper\" but you will never be able to get the money back, where by owning a property eventually you pay it off and can resell it if you desire.\n\nThe reason people like to own a property is because as long as the value remains steady it essentially costs you \"Nothing\" outside of taxes/upkeep. If you live in it for 20 years and sell it for what you bought it for, you just lived in a house for \"Free\" \n\nWe will call the property 150,000 + 200,000 in costs over your life if you don't sell it and live there all 60 years. This is a tiny house for one person. If you live in NY, I'm sorry but the 200,000 just turned into 600,000 but lets just pray you don't.\n\nCost of living, in the USA you need a car unless you live in a city- but lets pray you don't because cities are stupid expensive. Car lasts 10 years (rough estimate) costs 20,000. 20,000 x 6 = 120,000\n\nUpkeep on car + Gas + Costs of living = 10,000 a year as long as you don't travel much/keep the car in good condition/don't eat out every day\n\nTOTAL IT OUT: \n\n* Small cheap home/costs of renting for 60 years: 350,000 $ (If you buy, you can get a lot of this back when you decide to sell and move which makes this an interesting category as the house can essentially cost you nothing, and just act as a bank account you can't touch until you move.)\n\n* Costs of cars at a 10 year life span: 120,000 $\n\n* Costs of living/utilities/insurance over 60 years: 600,000 $\n\n* Extra stuff/things I've missed: 100,000 $\n\nThis is not counting the money you will make off of interest, and state by state the taxes will be different so the costs of living could fluctuate dramatically depending.\n\nIf you took this as a magical lump some in a savings account and somehow avoided getting the shit taxed out of it you could live off the interest and be extremely poor- or invest it and live well enough off of dividends. This is a difficult question to answer due to the fact that currency- especially the dollar, might not hold over the next 60 years. I also don't know how \"rich\" you want to live.\n\nThe long and short of it though: 1.1 million $ to live as \"Lower-middle class\" and taking it as a given that it is simply just you and not a family"

            "In humans and most mammals the sex ration are 50/50 because the sperm either gets an X or a Y, which determines the sex of the baby, and this process does not favor either chromosome.\n\nSome species have other sex-determining mechanisms and other favored ratios. Ants, for example, are almost all female. Some species can switch sexes as needed. Some species generate equal numbers of both sex embryos then naturally abort more of one sex before birth.\n\nIncluding humans. Female fetus are more resistant to maternal stress than male fetus. So in a highly stressful environment for mothers a human population will generate more female babies.\n\nThere is no 'balancing' other than what has been most evolutionary successful. In human populations, for example, a stress-free mother has historically indicated an upper-class mother, and thus a male child would be favored because he can spread his genes to more grandbabies than a female could; while a stressed mother has tended to be lower-class and females have historically passed on their genes at a 2:1 ratio to males, albeit the successful males are much more successful."

The original DOCSIS had something called BPI which is part of what told each modem the 'address' to listen for, and BPI+ added encryption to each individual modem using a key exchange much in the same way that HTTPS uses SSL (This was originally 56bit DES, and has since been improved to 128bit AES in BPI+ SEC which was introduced with DOCSIS 3.0)\n\nNow here is the tricky part, and why the answer still is \"It Depends on your ISP\".  All of the encryption features are completely optional, and are not enabled by default.  They are quite simple to implement (on the ISP side) and I don't personally know of any ISPs that are not running at least the 56bit DES version of BPI+ on their plants (as it also helps prevent theft of service), I am sure there are a few out there that have not enabled it."

            "Hi, biologist here!\n\nSimply put, when our tongue tastes that delicious food, it sends a message to our brain describing what's in there. The brain might have formed an association with certain chemicals being found in foods that are nutritionally good, so you feel pleasure when you eat these foods. When kids start eating things, they're often very picky about what they eat because unfamiliar foods contain unfamiliar spices. The brain doesn't know what the hell is going on with all these weird chemicals and rejects them. Instead, they prefer relatively bland foods that have lots of fat, salt, protein and carbohydrate in them. Eventually, you'll start tasting these spices in conjunction with those chemicals that you already know and love like sugar, and associations of pleasure will connect to the taste of certain spices or flavours.\n\nFor example, things like anchovies are very much an acquired taste. The way you \"acquire\" it is by eating it in small amounts with things that you already enjoy. If you like it, you'll start to associate the taste of small, salty fish with delicious pizza, and soon they'll taste like small, salty, delicious fish.",

So the strong stench of blue cheese actually is an indication that it is safe to eat.",

            "Here's the really simple overview.\n\nBritish companies with an interest in business ventures in India used private armies and British military forces to force compliance with the deals they were making with various rulers on the Indian subcontinent (which was divided between many large and small nation-states rather than being one large country).  Indian authorities who tried to stop them ended up dead.\n\nRussia appeared interested in making a southern move across Afghanistan and into India and the UK responded by flooding the subcontinent with soldiers and fighting wars around the India/Afghani border via its proxies and forces against Russian forces and proxies.  To support this conflict the UK created military bases and supply lines from one end of the subcontinent to the other.\n\nThe British parliament realized it had ended up in control of India almost by accident and subsequently implemented a command and control scheme in the territory, adding it by fiat to the British Empire.\n\nThe Indians didn't want to be ruled from England and they resisted colonialization.  Eventually the most effective group of resisters coalesced around a man named Gandhi, who made \"nonviolent civil disobedience\" the centerpiece of his strategy to win freedom for India.  The moral superiority of his stance compared to the brutal and violent tactics of the British authorities gained worldwide attention and admiration and slowly moved the debate towards Indian independence.\n\nAfter WWII, the UK was exhausted in spirit and economy and could no longer support the hard line military presence required to continue to subjugate India.  In the end they gave up, went home, and turned the place over to Gandhi and his associates.  \n\nThe sad afterward to this story is that Hindus and Muslims couldn't set aside their differences and a breakaway faction of Muslims in Gandhi's inner circle forced the partition of the subcontinent into India, Pakistan and the territory that eventually became Bangladesh.  Gandhi was assassinated because he tried to make peace between Hindu and Muslim, between India and Pakistan.\n\nToday all that remains of British imperialism in India (beyond the memories and the human social cost) are a number of good schools, a government structure and bureaucracy modeled on the colonial British system, a lot of english-speaking Indians (and Pakistanis) and a love for the sport of cricket.",

            "The road industry has two seasons: plowing snow and repairing roads.  Freeways are very long lasting solutions, and they only require repaving every 30-40 years.  However, that means repaving 3% of the road every year, plus any new lanes that are added.\n\nCity streets and non-Interstate highways are not s long lived because they face another problem, right of way access.  For convenience and protection, many localities put power and communications underground with water, gas, and sewer.  If any of those 5 utilities need more capacity or infrastructure replacement, the road must be cut up.  It doesn't pay to have a road that lasts so long that all 5 utilities get to dig it up, so repaving is more frequent.",
            "The reason its constnat is because of pavement management techniques that let them monitor the conditions of each road and make repairs as necessary. Since there are a very large amount of roads and they are being constantly damaged, this results in there being pretty much constant work to stop any of it from deteriorating to the point where it causes serious, hard to repair infrastructure problems.",
            "There probably are long-lasting solutions, but they are cost-prohibitive, meaning that any single city cannot possibly afford, on tax dollars alone, to install long-lasting solutions throughout their entire transportation network.\n\nTo balance that out, there are standards, usually issued at the state level, regarding how often roads need to be repaired, depending on a variety of factors like materials used, traffic patterns, weather patterns, and what sort of road it is (a short road in a residential neighborhood might need to be looked at less often than a highway onramp, for instance).\n\nPlus, frankly, it keeps people in jobs. I live in a city that is CONSTANTLY having roads, sewers, and sidewalks repaired, and I get annoyed, but at the same time I see those workers out there in any kind of weather working their asses off and I'm glad that they are going to be able to put food on their table tonight.",

All of this is a long lasting solution (10-30 years generally) but it is something that never ends. A soon as you finish one stretch of repair or finish building one new road, there is is a new road that needs to be repaired or a new road they want to build.",
            "I have some economic analysis and appraisal background, so I tend to think about infrastructure as a depreciable asset, much like a house or an office building.  Infrastructure derives its utility in different ways from private property, but all are affected by ordinary depreciation and also by non-ordinary physical, functional, and economic obsolescence factors that have to be considered.  For the purposes of capital budgeting, these factors may be curable or incurable.\n\n* Physical obsolescence is when the infrastructure has deferred maintenance or some casualty loss which impairs its utility or shortens its life expectancy.  It can be curable with repair or economically incurable except by replacement.  (This is not the same thing as ordinary repair and maintenance.)\n\n* Functional obsolescence is when the infrastructure is inadequate for the utility it is intended to provide.  Traffic congestion is an obvious example, and a common design error is not anticipating induced demand in the design, creating bottlenecks in other parts of the road network, or excessive stacking at intersections which can lead to gridlock.  Other examples of functional obsolescence are that a road may lack emergency lanes or it may have curves that are too sharp for design speeds, or a bridge may be too low for ships to pass underneath.  Sometimes these things are curable.  For example, you could re-stripe and re-sign two parallel streets to make them one-way streets and improve traffic capacity and speeds.  But usually, functional obsolescence is incurable without replacement.  (It is important to understand functional obsolescence because lobbyists for engineering firms like to use this as a buzzword to convince policymakers to increase infrastructure spending.  Something that is functionally inadequate is not necessarily unsafe, only sub-optimal; but the public tends to think that they are in imminent danger when they hear that about functionally obsolete bridges in particular.)\n\n* Economic obsolescence (also called external obsolescence) is something not having to do with the road that makes the road less functional.  So...twenty years from now, if driverless cars and driverless rideshares cause cars to be driven more efficiently along roads, those roads may become remarkably uncongested.  There could easily be an excess of pavement.  If we build an eight-lane freeway today designed for today's circumstances and that project has a 40-year life expectancy, but after 15 years a four-lane freeway would have sufficed, that is a change in the economy that undermines the value of the freeway as an investment.  External obsolescence is not curable; it just is.\n\nMost of this stuff is relevant where major capital budgeting is concerned, but it is directly applicable if and only if the bureaucratic process for capital budgeting makes sense in the first place.

            "For federal highways and interstates, they're numbered according to which direction they run in and where they're located.  East-west highways are even-numbered and north-south highways are odd numbered.\n\nFor interstates, the lower numbers are in the west and south, and increase as you move north or east (such as I-5 in California and I-95 on the east coast, or I-10 in Florida and I-94 in Minnesota).  This system is reversed for federal highways: lower numbers are found in the north and east and increase as you move south or west (US-1 on the east coast and US-97 in Washington).\n\nThree-digit highway numbers indicate a spur (first digit is odd) or loop (first digit is even) off of a highway.  In Washington DC, which Interstate 95 passes through, you'll also find the loop I-495 (the Capitol beltway, which loops around I-95) and the spur I-395 (which branches off of I-95 and ends elsewhere).  This same principle holds true for federal highways: a spur off of US-1 might be numbered US-301, while a loop around it might be numbered US-401.  Finally, numbers for spurs and loops may be re-used in other states: there is another spur numbered I-395 in Maryland, which is not in any related to the highway in Washington DC.\n\nI don't know how state and county routes are numbered; in my state, they seem to be pretty random."

            "I fielded an answer to a \"Why was the Khmer Rouge so bad/What was the Cambodian genocide?\" question a few weeks ago. It follows:\n\n >  Wow, where to begin. The Khmer Rouge was a communist revolutionary government in Cambodia in the mid/late 70's. It was founded by a group of largely western-educated Cambodians who entirely rejected concepts of the free market and individual liberties. Instead, they attempted to construct an entirely self-sustaining nation through a rigid regime of top-down social engineering. This included the abolishment of banking, finance, currency, and some religions. People living in urban areas were (often forcibly) moved to the rural areas of the country to work in agriculture (again, often against their will). It was a bold and frankly inhuman stab at what could conceivably be called a \"classless\" society.\n\n >  The genocide came in a number of forms, which included but were not limited to:\n\n >  * **Famine.** The urban workers relocated to the fields knew nothing about agriculture, so land was not nearly cultivated to its full potential, resulting in mass famine almost immediately after the regime took control.\n\n >  * **Disease.** The Khmer Rouge believed that the country should be autonomous in all respects, including medicine. If the country did not have the resources to produce a certain drug, that drug was entirely unavailable (at least to the non-ruling class). As a result, thousands died to common and preventable diseases.\n\n >  * **Execution and reeducation.** Violations of the regime's anti-capitalist tenets were generally punishable by death. If you hoarded food, you could be executed. If you harvested wild crops, you could be executed. If you traded for a profit, you could be executed. Naturally, if you ever spoke out (publicly or privately) against the regime or its principles, you could be executed. Needless to say, corporal punishment was doled out without judicial process. Additionally, torture and execution were doled out on those suspected of being an enemy of the regime. This included anyone with material ties to the former government, many people with college-level educations, individuals of other ethnic backgrounds (including Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai), virtually any practicing religious person, anyone unable to grow their assigned crops (at quotas well in excess of those achievable before the regime took power), almost anyone who spoke English or French, and even people who simply wore glasses.\n\n >  In short, it was an attempt to reboot civilization (sans capitalism) and establish a society without wealth or class. As explained above, the Khmer Rouge did not tolerate non-believers well.\n\nAs with many genocides, it didn't start that way. But things got out of hand quickly.\n\n**tl;dr:** Western educated dictator class sought to completely rewrite civilization and invent a classless society. Mass famine and genocide ensued.",
            "The KR actually started in the 60's but didn't gain attention until the early 70's. Internal communists were taken seriously in the 60's and were automatically executed by the King's order. They then started going into hiding and formed a secret alliance which would later be known as the Khmer Rouge. The KR were basically really poor pheasants and farmers who lived in the country side. As the cold war was going on, King Sihanouk (King/Elected Prime Minister of Cambodia) wanted to stay neutral to both the US and it's neighboring country Vietnam. As a result, Vietnam troops entered Cambodia through the borders and the US started bombing the border and countryside killing an estimated half a million innocent Cambodian pheasants. As a result, the KR hated city dwellers, western ideas and wanted to abolish anything foreign from Cambodia. In 1970, a coup d'etat which was backed the be US had taken over the government and outsed King Sihanouk while he was out of the country which was known as the Lon Nol regime. Ironically Lon Nol's army was led by Sirik Matak who is Sihanouk's cousin. It's rumored that Sirik was secretly in love with Sihanouk's wife. The Lon Nol government was pro-western and vowed to fight the Vietnamese out of Cambodia. As this was going on, people on the country side were still getting attacked by both Vietnam and the US and as a result people on the countryside started joining the Khmer Rouge because they wanted to stop the bombings. No one had any idea what their real ideologies were when joining. Another reason why they were able to recruit so many members is most of the country side folks lived in remote areas and didn't have much access to radio, news, or what was going on. As King Sihanouk has been outsed and staying in China, the Khmer Rouge vowed to fight this war against the Lon Nol government and allowing King Sihanouk back into his throne. Therefor, Sihanouk started to support the KR and those who were loyal to the king also supported the KR. When the US finally left in 1975 is when the KR finally gained complete control of the country. The took over the city oun April 17th and ordered everyone to the country side. This is were they started the \"cleansing\" of western influences.\n\nsource: i'm obsessed with the subject",

As you may know, light is made up of many different frequencies.  Our human eyes can only see a small segment of of those wavelengths - this is called the \"visible light\" spectrum.  Visible light is made up mostly of the colors of the rainbow.  Red is the lowest frequency, violet being the highest.  (ultraviolet is above visible violet, but mostly invisible to us.  Infrared is just below visible red, for example).  When we see every spectrum at once, it appears white to us; \"white light\" is in fact all of the frequencies of visible light combined.\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecules interact with light in three ways.  A molecule can either reflect (shoot back) parts of the visible spectrum, transmit (let the light through) or absorb (take the light in).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Water is made up of H20 - one hydrogen and two oxygen molecules.  These molecules interact with the light that hits them.  Water, molecules *transmit* most of the light.  So it appears clear, although the information is slightly distorted, because some of the photons will be slightly disturbed on their way through.  \n\n\n\n\n\nMilk is made of several different compounds, but mostly, milk is made of fat. Fats, by the virtue of their molecular compound, reflect almost every wavelength, and so they appear white. \n\n\n\n\n\nSubstances that are clear or clear-ish transmit light.  Substances that are white reflect almost all light in the visible spectrum.  Substances that are another color, say, red, absorb all of the other colors in the frequency, but reflect red light.  So the object appears red to your eyes, because red light is bouncing off it.  Ironically, the color that an object appears to be is actually the color it repulses most!"

However to the public it sounds like you are too slow and quiet because the sounds takes some time to go from the bass guitar across the stage to you. So to make sure you hear the beat and the music as the public hear it you need to monitor the sound coming though the sound system.\n\nBefore sound systems small bands used to stand much closer together on the stage and look at each other rather then out to the public.

Although usually the fees are massively inflated. \n\nBottom line you pay either way just in a different way.",
            "Phone systems were built a long time ago, when international communication was really expensive - that set a precedent. \n\nGenerally phone companies were national monopolies, often with legal protection from competition. So they would charge high fees to other telecoms trying to hand calls into their country. They could do thid because there was no other option and international calling fees weren't worried about by most people (in effect these fees were like the cream that the teleco was allowed in payment for providing an affordable national calling infrastructure).\n\nThen the internet came along. Many ISPs started as small competitive startups offering service over phone lines (dial up). That meant they were keen to freely interconnect with content providers as it made them more competitive  (by providing better service to their customers), even when they were far apart they could get cheap links as they'd have access to a \"telecom hotel\" with lots of companies competing to offer connections between cities/towns/etc.\n\nSo internet access has become very cheap, phone providers haven't kept up.\n\nN/B: this should also provide you with a good background on net neutrality. As the US shifts to a monopolised infrastructure  (you could dial into any dial up provider but most americans only have one or two high speed cable options) ISPs are trying to shift back to the old model where they had much more power over what they charged consumers. In countries with more open infrastructure  (eg in NZ you can choose any fibre provider in your local exchange, normally a few dozen options) this isn't such an issue.",

            "Headache pain mostly is not like pain in other parts of the body.  Some headache pain is from sore muscles.  Most of it is from the arteries that supply the brain.  The brain itself cannot sense pain - it has no nerve endings to detect pain - but many arteries do enter the brain to bring blood, and those arteries do have nerve endings.\n\nHeadaches have to do with sudden changes in the size of brain arteries.  Brain arteries are always dilating and constricting in order to regulate the amount of blood that goes to the brain.  This process gets fouled up in some headaches, and the arteries constrict tightly for a few minutes, then dilate excessively.  When the arteries dilate excessively they get swollen and inflamed, and their nerve endings report this as pain.\n\nFinally, headaches have to do with an alteration in the way your brain is paying attention to pain.  During a headache, all things are perceived as more painful than at other times - including the headache itself.  This process may actually be important for the generation of headaches in the first place."

The idea of nationalism was heavily promoted around this time to give people the desire and will to fight for their nation. \n\nDisclaimer: Friedman can be a controversial subject, and he's not necessarily the majority opinion on political science.

            "I see a lot of opinion here and a lot of sway one way or the other. Instead ill answer from what little I've picked up on the reason for patriotism / nationalism / jingoism and that mentality you are asking about:\n\nI'll try to ELI5 it: way back when a guy was living in a cave and there were dangerous things outside, things that wanted to come into the cave and kill him and his family. He found that there was a guy in a cave not too far away in a similar predicament and by banding together they could defend their family, and not only that they could go out and get more food. They then found another few guys and families and found that by getting together, dividing their efforts on tasks and working with eachother they could even improve their comfort levels and basic standards of living.\n\nObviously time goes by and the clan gets bigger and stronger and more prosperous and they come across another clan just like them. Only this clan thinks differently... and they want the first clans women, their food they worked so hard for, and the nice cave and settlement structure they had built. Now the first clan have all grown up around eachother and have a similar way of thinking so they don't want to be servants to clan 2. They fight back and are victorious and so can go on living as they do. Through this and through child after child being brought up in a similar environment with similar teachings the first clan are all like minded and they all know deep down that by sticking together and always protecting one another they will survive and prosper. \n\nRinse and repeat this until the clan is hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions. \n\nIt's old clan mentality of survival and the preservation of the way of life. \n\nHowever silly it may seem to care about a guy who lives down the street from you more than the guy who lives on the other side of an ocean it is based in a (hopefully) \"mutual\" understanding that you will maintain and improve the way of life as you see it along with like minded people within your culture and place of living. \n\nIt's a ridiculous continued mindset now because people from all over the world travel to live together so the nationalist / patriotic / or jingoistic mentality is false as it no longer leads to improvements, it leads to closed mindedness, exclusionary conservative ways of thinking (meant in the dictionary definition) which give you racism, prejudice and empires that go stomping into other countries, giving them weapons to kill eachother, and then killing them for the gains of the empire. \n\nThis last bit isn't aimed at America by the way, countries have been doing this since the beginning of leadership. You give the clan who come asking in the right way a trade agreement for arms and training, they go off killing people who they don't like and then start getting a little \"big for their boots\" in the eyes of the first empire who now see them as a possible threat, so they go in and kill everyone and try to convert what's left to their way of thinking. Only this other clan has their own mindset and bringing in behavioural changes is almost impossible, so you leave and rinse and repeat this situation. \n\nEDIT: FYI the pride aspect is a subcondition of all of this; it's built upon the thought process that by backing up, agreeing with, and feeling good about what members and representatives of your clan are doing then you are effectively furthering the efforts and mindset of your clan.",

The only problem is that the modern human society is billions strong and according to [Dunbars number](_URL_0_), any one human can only keep a strong social connection with a maximum of somewhere between 100 and 250 people. This in turn leads to a very strong \"Us versus THEM\" mentality, and people naturally tend to choose a banner that most of the people in their group fall under, like \"roots for this sports team\" or \"is a member of this country\".\n\nI should point out that while I say \"Us versus Them\", I do not intend to insinuate that the two groups are ALWAYS in conflict; it is perfectly possible to have one of these conflicts but to only feel \"meh\" about the opponents.

What do you call the \"batter\" in kickball, anyway?), there is a sense that we all contributed to something bigger than ourselves and our friends will like us more. This makes your team even more separate from the other team, and you want to get along with your team more than you do with the other. So, over time, because you care about doing well and your team doing well, you have spent most of your time paying attention to it and tend to overlook the problems it has. \n\nOn the other hand, the other team is competition, and it's easy to pick out their faults because you want to find them to make sure your team can win. So over time you come to think of your team as better (ignoring its faults) and the other team as inferior (full of faults and nothing else).",

It exhibits the Northern Cities Vowel Shift.  The **East** and **Northeast** typically resists merging pin/pen, cot/caught, mary/merry/marry.  As a result they have more vowel variation.  Some NE dialects are non-rhotic and nasal.  You will find larger differences between individual states here.\n\nThe **Midlands** have some diversity, like in Ohio/Indiana... I'm not familiar with them.  The **South** has a good deal of diversity, but most dialects are characterized by the Southern Cities Vowel Shift.  Some also have drawls, where an extra schwa vowel (uh) is added after glides.  Some dialects have double negatives.  Again, there is sometimes non-rhoticism.\n\nThe **North Central** typically merges the vowels I mentioned resisted by the NE accents.  This accent is on the UP of Michigan, and northern WI/MN. They have strong rhotics and unreleased final consonants.  \"bag/flag/tag\" are pronounced \"beyg,fleyg,teyg.\"\n\nI believe there is a California Vowel Shift as well, but everything west of the Mississippi river is a mystery to me.\n\nSome dialects round their lips when pronouncing \"sh\" and \"r\" but I don't know who does/doesn't.\n\n**Caveat:  Do not confuse vowel sounds with vowel letters.  Our alphabet has 5 vowels, but the alphabet is irrelevant.  Most Americans have 10-12 vowel phonemes, not counting diphthongs.**",

        "output": [
            "Because FM is a newer and better technology:\n\nImagine the radio waves are light. AM transmits by changing the brightness of a light (Amplitude Modulation), FM transmits by changing the colour of the light (Frequency Modulation).\n\nIf you have a clear view of both lights then they both sound good, but imagine if you're driving and trees get in the way of the light beam. You can still see the light through the leaves, but not as well. \n\nWith AM the brightness of the light keeps changing as leaves block it so the volume keeps going up and down. With FM it doesn't matter how bright the light is because you only care about the colour, which doesn't change.\n\nThe reason you still have AM as well as FM because AM is much cheaper to broadcast and the signals travel further.",
            "The A.M. signal is a much simpler way to transmit audio through radio signals.  It was the first type to be invented, and the receiver needs fewer parts to make it work.  In A.M., there is a lower frequency radio signal that carries the audio, and the strength of the signal is \"wiggled\" up and down to make the sound come out of the speaker. \n\nF.M. signals require a higher frequency, and more complicated parts to work.  The frequency of the signal is \"wiggled\" a little higher and lower to make the sound come out of the speaker.\n\nWhen you turn on a light switch or have a noisy electrical motor, or during an electrical storm, there is a jolt of radio noise that interferes with nearby radios.  The jolt interferes with the strength of the signal - which is why it is reproduced as a pop in the speaker of an A.M. radio, but is mostly silent in an F.M. radio which only follows the frequency change, not the amplitude (strength) change.",
            "Partly because AM radio is subject to more interference than FM.  Partly because FM was developed as a higher-fidelity alternative to AM.",
            "Related question undeserving of it''s own thread:  why do AM stations power down at night?  My favorite local AM station has an abrupt power up at sunrise and a down at sunset where the quality goes from passable at night to excellent during the day.  I thought it was audience related but it seems to follow the sun and isn't affected by time or DST.\n\nSorry if I'm violating thread etiquette.",
            "In addition to stgnet's excellent explanation, there are the actual effects of the technology and legislation.\n\n1) AM radio signals usually broadcast about 40Hz-5kHz, which means from quite low (deep, bass) to only moderately high. If you have a stereo with tone controls, turn the \"treble\" knob all the way down and the bass knob about halfway down, and you'll get an idea of what these limitations are like.\nFM, in contrast, is about 30Hz-15kHz, which means it goes from deeper bass to much higher treble.\n\n2) The FM signal has a much bigger dynamic range. This means that the difference between the quietest and the loudest sounds is much bigger than with AM.\n\n3) Also, while AM stereo exists, it's hardly ever used. FM is generally stereo.\n\nA good FM signal (which is rarely broadcast) with a good FM tuner (which is very hard-to-find) can sound really good - almost as good as an excellent CD. A typical FM signal through a normal stereo tuner is still going to sound pretty good.",
            "I have a question, if FM changes the frequency, how can there be different stations? What are the differences between from one station and the next?\n\nI imagine in AM radio, that the frequency would be the difference between each station.\n\nBut with FM, how can that work?

You will find no FM but the AM is going strong.    AM  signal can be picked up from 4 times the distance.   Although most comments about the two are correct they leave out AMs greatest feature, signal distance.",

            "With IBOC (aka HD Radio) AM stations can sound just as good as a FM station and FM stations sound CD quality. This is done by sending a digital signal with the analogue waveform. The HD in this case stands for hybrid digital. On AM broadcasts the HD signal can recreate sounds up to about 15KHz using a 30kbit digital stream to make it sound like a FM station. FM HD signals can achieve CD quality sound since it has a 300kbit digital stream. This digital stream has enough bandwidth to provide a 150kbit stream for the FM station and create digital sub channels like 95.5 HD-2, 95.5 HD-3. In my area some of these stations simulcast their AM station on a FM HD substation or specialized programming. My favourite is 93.1 Jack FM HD-2 which is _URL_0_ Discover.",
            "Here's my take, apologies if I'm parroting anyone from earlier:\n\nAM is based on power changes; sounds are converted to big or little bumps on a carrier signal. FM changes the frequency of the carrier signal. That's all been said. The reason for clarity and reception differences are this:  AM is by design very sensitive to amplitude changes; drive through a tunnel and the degraded signal is heard as static. But FM doesn't care about amplitude; you only need a very small bit of it to \"see\" the frequency changes. This is why FM stays clear until you're basically out of reception area, then it basically goes dead.",
            "AM transmits data by changing brightness while FM transmits data by chaning \"colors\" in an invisible spectrum.\n\nBrightness is directly affected by distance making brightness measurements less accurate while color is only slighly changed by distance, so getting the accurate color from a far away signal is easyer.",

            "As far as I can tell, when streaming a video it may start off at 480p. As the video plays, it starts to buffer a higher 720p. This process may have started 5 seconds into the video, but in an attempt to avoid interrupting your playback it starts loading the 720p video from the 20 second mark.\nIf you happen to skip forward within that 20 second window of 480p video, it will attempt to load the video from that point in 720p, thus resetting the buffered video.\nThis is a side effect of YouTube's adaptive streaming.\nHope this answers your question!",
            "YouTube does not actually pre-buffer the entire video anymore. With the advent of HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) and DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP), most on demand videos are actually played back in the same manner as livestreaming.\n\nThe browser receives a manifest of all the chunks of video (usually 2-10 seconds in length each) along with different resolutions for each chunk.

As mentioned, Youtube no longer gathers a long buffer, as they determined that most people have enough bandwidth to stream their video instead. For the few people that don't have enough bandwidth, Youtube added an adaptive quality feature that automatically makes the video shit if your internet isn't as good as they think it should be. \n\nBecause the video quality can keep changing for people with sub-par internet, and because the people with fast internet don't care, Youtube figured that storing the video for seeking purposes isn't worth the effort to program or the space that buffer takes up. If they allowed you to skip a few seconds forward, would they then have to allow you to skip one second back as well in case you overshoot? It's just easier to toss everything.",

The core will get smaller, because there are less hydrogen atoms in it, but this will cause the core to actually heat up, and start speeding up the helium-making process. Because the Sun will be making more and more helium faster and faster, the Sun will expand into a Red Giant (100 times the size of what it is now, and no, Earth will not survive!). Once all the energy finally runs out, the core will start to cool off, and the change in temperature will cause the Sun to start throwing off its outer layers, which will form a [nebula](_URL_1_) surrounding what's left of the core (which will be called a \"White Dwarf,\" and which will finally cool completely into a Black Dwarf and officially die)."

            "There's an old joke about how McDonald's spends millions of dollars doing market research to figure out where to put new locations while Burger King just waits to see what McD's does  &  buys property across the street from them.\n\nThe idea is that a good spot for a fast food restaurant is good because there's a steady flow of people past it.  It might be a freeway exit on the way home to a suburb or it might be next to a large office complex.  The point is that a good location is good because people are going to be eating a lot of food.  If the same people are eating every day, they'll probably want some variety  &  multiple restaurants can thrive without hurting each other.\n\nIn fact, in some cases, building *more* stores next to each other is actually helpful.  Let's look at two cases:\n\nTake a big store, like a Sears.  Intuitively, you don't want to build  store right next to them, because you'd be competing.  It doesn't matter if it's another large department store or a small electronics store - you don't want to be in the shadow of the giant.\n\n...but if you take 4-5 big stores  &  a few hundred small stores and stick them together **you get a mall**.  It's now a destination for people that are shopping  &  all the stores actually benefit.\n\nSame thing goes for bars.  If there's only one bar in town, building one across the street from it is ridiculous.  If you build a dozen bars on the same street, all within walking distance, you get the 'entertainment district' where people go on a Friday night to walk from bar to bar.  It becomes a reason for go there rather than picking just one bar  &  having to stick with it.\n\nFast food restaurants can do the same thing if you pack a bunch of them together.",

For example, if you have three fancy shoe stores next to each other, that neighborhood gets a reputation as the \"shoe district\" and starts drawing more customers. \n\nThis explanation doesn't really work for a CVS and Walgreens, since those stores sell almost identical items, but for something like fancy restaurants or boutique clothing, it's a real effect that is backed up by the economic literature. \n\nThe other answers here also make a good point that it's more important to locate in high-traffic areas than it is to separate yourself from your competitors. If being next to a competitor was a terrible idea, shopping malls would all shut down.",

In a perfect world, I suspect they all would like to be the \"only game in town\" for their market niche.\n\nIt is more likely that these businesses are located near one another because that area happens to be an area where there is a need for businesses of that type. For example, in the blocks around large office buildings (where office workers have a need for meal-time food, coffee, happy hour drinks, etc...), you tend to find fast food and sit-down restaurants of all types.",
            "The presence of YOU in the location is far more important than the presence or absence of the competitor food chain.  \n\nIf a location has 100,000 eaters and 70% of the time people prefer mcDonalds to Burger King then Burger King has to find a location that has 30,000 eaters who would eat at burger king in the absence of mcDonalds.  Then...burger king has to think about the risk of mcDonalds moving in...that 30,000 then drops immediately to about 10,000 and suddenly the store isn't profitable/viable anymore.  \n\nIf burger king could uniquely defend its territory it might make sense to build in unique locations, but...all they are doing is testing a location for mcDonalds to come in and steal the marketshare from relatively small pool of eaters, putting the entire franchise at risk.  Many times its better to go where there are a ton of eaters.  Grab your 30% and then work to trying to make that 40%.",

It is said to be one of the three \"marks of existence\" which all sentient beings experience,  &  the [4 Noble Truths](_URL_0_) on which are some of the core teachings in Buddhism all relate to dukkha.\n\nDukkha isn't quite the same as suffering, but it's often translated that way. There are 3 aspects of dukkha: \n\n* the suffering of physical and mental illness, growing old, and dying;\n* the anxiety or stress of trying to hold onto things that are constantly changing; and\n* dissatisfaction pervading all forms of life, due to the fact that all forms of life are impermanent and constantly changing.\n\nThe Four Truths I mentioned above are sort of the \"goals\" of Buddhism. \n\nThe first is to understand the nature of dukkha  &  how it exists in the world in a realistic manner, so not despairing about the badness in the world, but at the same time not ignoring it.\n\nThe second is to understand what causes dukkha: \n\n* Craving for sense-pleasures (kama-tanha): this is craving for sense objects which provide pleasant feeling, or craving for sensory pleasures.\n* Craving to be (bhava-tanha): this is craving to be something, to unite with an experience. This includes craving to be solid and ongoing, to be a being that has a past and a future, and craving to prevail and dominate over others.\n* Craving not to be (vibhava-tanha): this is craving to not experience the world, and to be nothing; a wish to be separated from painful feelings.\n\nThe third is cessation of dukkha; identifying how to remove these cravings from out life.\n\nThe fourth is known as the [Noble Eightfold Path](_URL_1_), considered to be the essential part of Buddhist practice. It's basically the way to live to overcome dukkha, which leads to self awakening. The Eight paths are: Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.\n\nThe Four Truths are often compared to a doctor dealing with an illness:  \nFirstly, the doctor must recognize that there is an illness.   \nSecondly, the doctor must identify the cause of the illness.  \nThirdly, the doctor must identify how to cure the illness.  \nFinally, the doctor prescribes a treatment of the illness so that it may be eventually overcome.\n\nI'm not a buddhist, so I don't have a huge amount of understanding of the subject, but I think that's a moderately correct overview of how dukkha relates to buddhism.",
            "Been a while since I've studied Buddhism, I'll see if I can remember.\n\nBasically, it's a realistic outlook about life and the human condition - that life is going to involve suffering, strife, and anxiety in some shape or form. This includes both physical and emotional forms of suffering. From heartache to stress to illness to growing old and dying, all humans go through suffering at some point. It is a defining feature of human life, according to Buddha.\n\nIt's not meant to pessimistic, rather realistic, because the teachings of Buddha center around understanding and eventually overcoming human suffering, at which point you reach Nirvana (Enlightenment)."

But, not all of the energy of the ray escapes the raindrop after it is reflected once. A part of the ray is reflected again, and travels along a different path inside the drop to emerge from the drop at a different angle. The rainbow we normally see is called the primary rainbow and is produced from one internal reflection. The secondary rainbow arises from two internal reflections and the rays exit the drop the second time at an angle of around 50o, rather than the 42o for the primary rainbow. This effect produces the secondary rainbow, with the colors reversed from the primary rainbow. It is possible for light to be reflected more than twice within a raindrop, but these additional rainbows are typically never seen under normal circumstances."

        "output": [
            "A few reasons. Of course, there are many others, but here are some highlights:\n\n1) In the 60s and 70s, keep in mind that New York City wasn't the only city undergoing turmoil. A combination of white flight (whites moving to the suburbs, decimating the tax base of the city proper), racial turmoil, and changing industrial landscape hit many cities hard. New York was the biggest, so it was hit the hardest.\n\n2) Labor strikes. Many government unions--teachers, sanitation workers, transit workers--would hold politically charged strikes. Often, garbage would pile up on the streets and catch fire. Whether justified or not, the strikes caused ripple effects across the city: whites on the fence finally moved, people stopped investing, etc.\n\n3) Fiscal concerns. With the tax base gone, more and more people required assistance, so tax collection was down while spending was up. (Other factors, such as an anemic stock market (which thus generated less revenue from Wall Street) and increased pay of government union employees) New York effectively stretched their credit as far as it could go. For years the city was always teetering on the brink of default, while different, increasingly shaky tactics were used to forestall the collapse. They eventually approached President Ford, who denied a bailout--he saw that none of the problems were being fixed and were just getting worse, so throwing money at the city without fundamental reform was a waste. (He eventually signed a different law that extended loans to the city.) Thus was the famous New York Daily News headline: \"Ford To City: Drop Dead.\"\n\n4) Crack Cocaine. Introduced in the 80's, a cheap, effective drug that spread quickly through the ghettos of New York. Crime increased dramatically.\n\n5) Crime. (By the mid-80's, New York had a crime rate 70% higher than the national city average. Well-publicized, racially charged violent murders started happening at an alarming rate. There were murders of blacks in white neighborhoods, a rape and beating of the \"Central Park Jogger,\" and increased riots and tension between blacks, Jews, whites, and Hispanics. This all came to a head with Bernie Goetz, the \"subway vigilante.\" Held up as a symbol of frustrated New York, he shot at four black youths who (allegedly) tried to rob him on a subway. (None died.) \n\nAll of these reasons fed off of one another. Whites moved to the suburbs because of crime, which decreased the tax base, which made paying for police officers harder, which made crack cocaine easier to spread, and so on.",

More specifically, they feared the people\u2019s power because, possessing, and esteeming, property, they wanted the rights of property protected against those who did not possess it. In the notes he made for a speech in the Constitutional Convention, James Madison wrote of the \u201creal or supposed difference of interests\u201d between \u201cthe rich and poor\u201d \u2014 \u201cthose who will labor under all the hardships of life, and secretly sigh for a more equal distribution of its blessings\u201d\u2014and of the fact that over the ages to come the latter would come to outnumber the former. \u201cAccording to the equal laws of suffrage, the power will slide into the hands of the latter,\u201d he noted. \u201cSymptoms, of a leveling spirit, as we have understood, have sufficiently appeared in certain quarters to give notice of the future danger.\u201d\"\n\n The corporate interests are baked into the constitution - What did you expect?",

And then, it was then subject to strict government regulation.\n\nSo, I would argue that rich men have always had a significant amount of power in our government, but the power of corporations is a relatively recent development--and their power waxes and wanes dependent upon socio-political circumstances, the economy, and the alertedness of the public.

            "[From John Grohol, PSY.D](_URL_0_):  I was browsing a blog the other day and saw an undated (recent?) entry suggesting that research shows that \u201cweather has little effect on our mood.\u201d The entry relied heavily on a recent study (Denissen et al., 2008) that shows that although a correlation between mood and weather does exist, it\u2019s a small one (not nearly as large as conventional wisdom might suggest). The entry quotes almost exclusively and entirely from the one study.\n\nI\u2019m familiar with this area of research, so I found the entry\u2019s conclusions a little simplistic and not really doing justice to this topic. There\u2019s a fair amount of research in this area (more than the 3 or 4 studies mentioned in the blog), and I think the overall preponderance of evidence suggests that weather can have more than just a \u201clittle effect\u201d on your mood.\n\nSome previous research confirms the blog entry\u2019s conclusion that weather may have little effect on our moods. For instance, Hardt  &  Gerbershagen (1999) looked at 3,000 chronic pain patients who came to a hospital over a 5-year period. The researchers had patients fill out a depression questionnaire, and then analyzed the results. They found no correlation between depression and the time of the year, nor the amount of daily hours of sunshine. But the researchers only examined depression, and didn\u2019t measure how much time subjects spent outside (a factor that some have suggested might influence how much the weather impacts us).\n\nOther research paints a very different picture.\n\nHoward and Hoffman (1984) had 24 college students keep track of their mood (by filling out a mood questionnaire) over 11 consecutive days. They found a significant effect on mood correlated with the weather, especially with regards to humidity (a component of weather not always measured):\n\n    Humidity, temperature, and hours of sunshine had the greatest effect on mood. High levels of humidity lowered scores on concentration while increasing reports of sleepiness. Rising temperatures lowered anxiety and skepticism mood scores. [...]\n\n    The number of hours of sunshine was found to predict optimism scores significantly. As the number of hours of sunshine increased, optimism scores also increased. [...]\n\n    Mood scores on the depression and anxiety scales were not predicted by any weather variable. \n\nAnother study by Sanders and Brizzolara (1982) on 30 college students also found similar findings \u2014 that high humidity was a predictor for lack of vigor, elation, and affection.\n\nBut you may dismiss these studies as small, or on unrepresentative samples (college students). You\u2019d have a harder time making that argument against Faust et al.\u2019s (1974) study on 16,000 students in Basle City, Switzerland. Although not the most robust study designed, the researchers nonetheless found that nearly one-third of the girls and one fifth of the boys responded negatively to certain weather conditions. Symptoms reported included poor sleep, irritability, and dysphoric (depressed) mood.\n\nIf you noticed that higher humidity is associated with certain mood states, you won\u2019t be surprised to hear there is also a good body of research that has investigated the link between heat and different types of human behavior, especially aggression (see, for example, Rotton  &  Cohn, 2004; Cohn  &  Rotton, 2005; Anderson, 1987; etc.). While there\u2019s some debate as to how strong a relationship exists between heat and violence, this is a relationship that been undergoing research since the 1970s. At this point, it\u2019s not in question whether a link exists, just how strong and what the relationship exactly looks like (and whether it\u2019s mediated by other factors, like time of day).\n\nThe Weather Can Affect You Negatively and Positively\n\nKeller and his colleagues (2005) examined 605 participants responses in three separate studies to examine the connection between mood states, a person\u2019s thinking and the weather. They found that:\n\n    [...P]leasant weather (higher temperature or barometric pressure) was related to higher mood, better memory, and \u2018\u2018broadened\u2019\u2019 cognitive style during the spring as time spent outside increased. The same relationships between mood and weather were not observed during other times of year, and indeed hotter weather was associated with lower mood in the summer.\n\n    These results are consistent with findings on seasonal affective disorder, and suggest that pleasant weather improves mood and broadens cognition in the spring because people have been deprived of such weather during the winter. \n\nSo while Denissen et al. (2008) found no general ability for the weather itself to lift us into a more positive mood (contrary to both Howard  &  Hoffman and Keller\u2019s findings above), the researchers did find that the weather can impact our moods negatively. And while that effect in the present study was small, it confirms the same effect found in a multitude of other studies (some of which are mentioned above).\n\nAnother way to look at it is that Denissen and colleagues confirmed prior research that showed that people\u2019s moods and emotions can definitely be affected by the weather. The strength of that relationship varies from person to person. But a study\u2019s design has a lot to do with trying to find this relationship in the data. And while Denissen\u2019s design was good, it wasn\u2019t foolproof. Its problems include the over-representation of women in the sample (89%), suggesting a skewed and biased sample, and the response rate, with participants submitting on average half the number of surveys needed by the study\u2019s design. In other words, the data may not be the most robust in the world either (despite the large sample size).\n\nSo, sorry, yes, weather does appear to impact our moods. And that effect may become serious. Look no further for evidence of this than the very real condition called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD is characterized by feelings of sadness and depression that occur in the winter months when the temperatures drop and the days grow short. This specific form of depression is often associated with excessive eating or sleeping and weight gain. Women are twice to three times more likely to suffer from the winter blues than men. If SAD is merely a \u201cculturally transmitted idea\u201d (as the blog quotes the researchers as suggesting), then so is every mental disorder to one extent or another.\n\nThe new research provides some contradictory data to previous findings. And when such discrepancies arise, the answer is not to conclude the matter settled, but to go and conduct more research. So what Denissen\u2019s study really shows is that more research is needed to better determine the strength of the link, and whether it affects people in different geographical regions (and countries).\n\nSo no, you\u2019re not crazy if you think your mood is affected by the weather. Nearly 40 years of research suggests there\u2019s a strong link. And one that, in some people, can lead to significant seasonal problems."

Also water is notable in that ice floats and therefore lakes will develop a layer of ice at the top while leaving liquid water below. Ice is also somewhat insulating so it slows the loss of heat from the surface of the water.\n\nThe result is that the depths of larger bodies of water will remain liquid and fish, who don't need to do anything at the surface, have no trouble continuing to survive."

        "output": [
            "Put in a very simple way:\n\nFat does not clog arteries by itself, fat deposits on blood vessel walls as a protective measure, against damaged caused to the lining by other things, mainly, sugar. its a protective measure to prevent further damage to the vessels, and to the blood constituents, the issue is that damage accumulates and so does fat unless lifestyle is changed. \n\nIn the early 20th century when people saw clotted arteries with fat, calcium etc, they erroneously assumed that those dietary elements were the factor that was causing the issue, without realising that they were blaming the defensive measure for the problem. Sadly medicine is this giant machine that takes ages to acknowledge information is inaccurate, and even longer to start changing how it deals with it, it takes decades. \n\n\nAnd analogy: They saw a huge traffic jam, they saw shinny lights (cops) and blamed the cops for the jam, instead of realising the cops are there because there was a car crash, which is the true factor to blame for the jam.\n\n\nKetogenic and vegetarian diets are good to help reduce and even reverse those issues, because you are removing the factors that cause damage to the inner lining of the blood vessels (excess sugar), also helps with diabetes as you prevent constant insulin spikes which lead to insensitivity. \n\n\nFats are needed by the body, and quite healthy in themselves, yes, even saturated which is quite important for you, the issue is also how much you eat. \n\n\nTL:DR: Sugars be the evil, not fat, fat just cool dudes helping you and getting all the blame.",
            "Saturated fats do not clog arteries.  Current [medical research](_URL_0_) has shown that there is no statistical link between the consumption of saturated fats and cardio vascular disease.\n\nThe ketogenic diet has many more aspects to it than just eating a lot of fats.  It is a very low carbohydrate, moderate protein, high fat diet.  The restriction of carbohydrates to less than 20-25g per day causes your body to enter ketosis, or to go into a ketogenic state.  In this state, your brain--the largest consumer of energy in your body--and which normally on the Standard American Diet runs entirely on glucose for energy, begins to shift and use ketone bodies produced by your liver for a majority of its energy needs.\n\nAt the same time, once liver and muscle stores of glycogen have been depleted and converted to glucose and utilized for energy, and the body begins to look for additional sources of energy. The next easiest of the dietary macros [carbohydrates, fats and protein] available to be converted to energy is dietary and stored body fat, which can be broken down into free fatty acids.\n\nThat is why the ketogenic diet works.  Since there is little to no sugar or carbs--except for a minimal amount still consumed, all of which goes to the brain's dominant and ongoing need for some amount of glucose--the body then starts using incoming dietary fats as its primary fuel.  \n\nThis process will then consume and burn all of the fats that are being eaten, and assuming that calorie intake has been lowered to a deficit as compared with calorie burn, will then result in your body breaking down fat cells into free fatty acids to then be transported into cells for energy production.\n\nIn a nutshell, that is how the ketogenic diet handles and uses the high amount of fats eaten, as they are now the primary source of energy.  Hope this helps.",
            "Because the science on fats has not been completely conclusive.\n\nCoconut has more saturated fat than bacon for instance.",
            "This is going to be full of uninformed people who are going to tell you that eggs and meat are bad, and that you NEEEEEEEEEEED sugar and carbs.",
            "You are beginning with a flawed premise: \"fats, which clog arteries?\" is not correct.",
            "Here is a very good article that talks in depth about this. _URL_1_",
            "If you have to assume something is true to come to a conclusion, and then cannot prove your assumption is true, then your conclusion isn't true, either.\n\nSo, having said that:\n\nLots of fats do not clog your arteries, in general.\n\nAs China pointed out there is no link between saturated fat and heart disease, although I'll touch on a paradox that is making rounds in the ketogenic scientific community regarding fat composition of the diet and cholesterol levels increasing in an unhealthy manner.\n\nThink of your artery as a 4-lane freeway. If there are 10 cars driving on it at any given time there's less likely a chance of an accident, and it's probably 3 AM. Now imagine that it's just before rush hour and there are a few hundred cars passing the same spot, per lane.\n\nThere's much more likelihood of an accident happening simply due to the increase of cars.\n\nNow, what is a clogged artery? It's the deposit of a CHOLESTEROL (very, very, very important point here, do not forget it) molecule behind the artery wall. It shouldn't be there. The cholesterol was like a car without wheels being transported on the back of a big rig (since cholesterol cannot move freely on the highway).\n\nSo imagine now that instead of 10 big rigs carrying cars, there are 200. Or 4000. Doesn't matter. If one of those big rigs gets into an accident, it's more likely that the car (cholesterol) is going to get dumped off the top of that big rig to somewhere it shouldn't be.\n\nIn this case, because there is an increase in the particles that carry cholesterol in your body there is an increase in the chance one of those particles is going to enter the artery lining and cause a cascade of inflammation that results in cholesterol getting deposited, which causes the site to interact even more with the cholesterol-containing particles and the cycle continues until you get the plaque formation (artery clog).\n\nEnough of this and it can dislodge and kill you, but before doing so will increase your blood pressure and cause all sorts of other issues.\n\nSo, when it comes to the ketogenic diet, the increase of saturated fat **seems** to be able to cause an remarkable increase in the particles I mentioned (LDL-P).\n\nLDL-P is one of THE driving factors (if not **the** factor) that drives risk of cardiovascular disease, because it's physically impossible for cholesterol to get into an artery unless it's being carried there. More big rigs with cars, more accidents with cars.\n\nNow, some people on this diet with the increase of fat start absorbing more cholesterol through their gut lining or start mass producing it. This is simple genetics.\n\nSo for those people, their freeways are now JAM PACKED with big rigs with cars, so much so that there is a legitimate concern of long-term health.\n\nSo while the studies show no link, there's seems to be a direct increase of LDL-P on the diet initially for some people, which is a bona fide concern for clogging your arteries, but even then only if the mass of that cholesterol (LDL-C) is also high.\n\nI have all sorts of graphs on this but since this is ELI5 I'll leave them out unless you want to see them.\n\nHowever, after 6 months, those levels balance out and can be further thrown off if one is also losing weight at the same time.\n\nTL;DR: **Too many cholesterol-carrying particles clog arteries, not fat.**",
            "It's kind of like saying that doctors cause illness because everytime people are sick you see doctors. If you eat a lot of fat and carbs then you will gain weight and clog your arteries because the insulin response from the carbs pushes the fat and sugar into the cells. The high carbs also cause inflammation which I think leads to the clogged arteries. \n\nIf you eat a normal meal at McDonalds you get 150g of carbs which is brutally high. Fries bun and pop are what makes you gain weight. This is guaranteed to cause an insulin response and all the fat that you ate with the meal gets stored in the cells as well. \n\nI did keto for a few months and got the rest of my family hooked on it. My parents, and two sister's families are all on it. They all say they feel better and have lost weight. I quit because I was having problems but I'm still pretty low carb and I feel a lot better than I did. I may try it again but I will never go back to eating lots of carbs again. I hated the cravings for sugar and the energy crashes. \n\nCheck out /r/keto for more info. It's a good place for info. They are very focussed on weight loss but can also help with the health side of it. \n\nThis [guy](_URL_2_) explains it pretty well.",
            "Please research it for yourself as I may not be 100% accurate here but this is my understanding. \n\n\nThere is very little you can do to clog or not clog your arteries through diet. Some people have high levels of cholesterol both good and bad, and others don't. It's your body and not subject to change. Even if you eat less fat, your cholesterol level will tend to do what it does. \n\nIt's like thinking a sugar free diet could cure diabetes. \n\nAnyway, ketoacidosis is what happens when your body doesn't get enough sugar and carbohydrate. The brain for instance doesn't get it's energy from fat and it doesn't get it's energy from protein, it gets most of it's energy from fast burning sugars. Sugars mostly come from carbohydrate groups not fat or protein. However in 'lean times' your liver can turn a high protein low carbohydrate diet into ketone bodies, which are a kind of fatty sugar. Your brain can run on ketones for extended periods and your liver is what makes this possible. \n\nSo instead of fat, carbs, protein, your body is mostly using fat, ketones, protein. The down side is ketones don't burn clean, and there are a lot of metabolic left overs from those reactions that your kidneys have to filter out of your blood. IE it's messy. In ketoacidosis you end up with so many ketones in your blood it actually changes your blood ph and so the kidneys have to filter even more out. \n\nOther side effects are ketogenic metabolism can release some odd smells during respiration not to mention your breath, and it gives you what can be though of as carnivore breath or acetone breath. \n\nthe other thing is you must supply a lot of protein with these kind of diets and eat a lot of calories because it's too tempting to your body to start leaching muscle and protein away from internal organs and muscles. Ketogenic metabolisms speed up the the fat burning metabolism in the body though and the other changes to body chemistry make it harder to store new fat, and take less time to burn existing fat to make energy. Where as high carbohydrate diets do the opposite. \n\nHuman beings are omnivores and our metabolism is adaptable enough for the same species to be vegan, omnivore, vegetarian, protein only, or fat and protein yet still live, thrive, and get energy.k \n\nIE we can eat just about anything and survive, our bodies will adapt. This doesn't address malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies though.",

            "There's a few techniques, but mostly they fall into two categories:\n\n1. Celestial navigation\n2. Surveying\n\nI know a little bit about celestial navigation: it's basically about figuring out your position on the Earth by observing the sky and using some instruments and tables.  So for example:\n\n* You can tell your latitude by measuring the angle that the sun and the horizon make at solar noon (the point of the day when the sun has risen to its highest point in the day), and comparing that to some tables based on the day.  Another one is measuring the angle between the horizon and the north star.  These technique was well known to mariners already in the 1400s.  Two traditional instruments for measuring angles include the [astrolabe](_URL_0_) and the [cross-staff](_URL_2_).\n* Longitude is a lot more difficult, and wasn't solved until the late 1700s.  To tell the longitude you need to simultaneously know the time at your unknown location and at a second, known location (like Greenwich, England).  Each minute of time difference is four degrees of longitude.  The difficulty is knowing the time at the other location when you're far away from it.\n\nThere are two types of classic solutions for longitude:\n\n* Suppose you have a book with accurate predictions of the times of eclipses of the moons of Jupiter in a known location, like Greenwich, England.  By observing at what time those eclipses happen at your location and comparing them to the book, you can tell the longitude.  The moons of Jupiter were popular early on for this, but the complication there is that it requires a telescope, which you can't use at sea; later people invented the [lunar distances method](_URL_3_), which can be used in a ship.\n* The other method is to build a very precise clock and set it to the time of a known location.  If the clock keeps time precisely, then you can just get the remote time from it, and compare it to the local time (which you can get by observing the solar noon, and modifying the time using a special table called the [equation of time](_URL_1_)).\n\nBefore the invention of the pendulum clock in 1657, there were no really accurate clocks, so it was next to impossible to tell the longitude accurately.  In the 1700s a lot of expeditions were organized where astronomers would take an accurate clock and telescopes to various locations and use these to measure the longitudes at those places.  That's when world maps started to become really accurate.  For example, astronomers in France around 1670 discovered that the earlier maps had exaggerated the longitudes, and that France was in fact 20% smaller than it had been thought.  The famous response from Louis XIV was that he lost more territory to his astronomers than to his enemies...\n\nSurveying is using geometry and trigonometry to measure distances, heights and directions with special instruments.  I think I'll let somebody who knows it better to describe it.",
            "It was a huge amount of work and in some places the results were pretty iffy. But you'd be surprised at how much map-making you can do with a bunch of theodolites, some survey tape or chain, a bunch of guys with really sturdy boots and century of work.
