The whole experience will be \"richer\".  Reddit itself will probably not change much, as it's an aggregation of content from elsewhere, but all those sites that are linked are going to need more bandwidth.\n\nIn order to cope with the increased demands, ISPs will be prompted to improve their service.  However... they don't NEED to.  Their audience needs their product and there isn't another option outside the big boys.  So what they'll likely do is increase the service *for those who pay for preferential treatment*.  That means links to big sites like the news outlets will keep up with the demands of the internet, while imgur and similar hosting sites will need to pony up the cash if they don't want to be left in the (relatively) dark ages of data transfer.",

This could make it harder for people to access Reddit, and it might even make the website go away.\" These sentences clearly explain the potential consequences of net neutrality going away and how it could impact a website like Reddit.",

            "answer": "How to play Warhammer 40k, The tabletop game\n\nTo play Warhammer 40k, you will need a few things. First, you will need miniatures of the Warhammer 40k universe. These can be bought pre-painted, or you can paint them yourself. You will also need a playing surface, dice, and some sort of measuring device (either a ruler or a tape measure). Finally, you will need the Warhammer 40k rulebook.\n\nSet up your playing surface. This can be a table, the floor, or even a large piece of cardboard. Place your miniatures on the playing surface. Once all players have their miniatures ready, you will need to agree on who will be the \"attacker\" and who will be the \"defender.\"\n\nThe attacker will take the first turn, and the defender will take the second turn. Players will alternate taking turns until one player either runs out of miniatures, or concedes the game.\n\nOn a player's turn, they will roll dice to see how many \"actions\" they can take. These actions include moving their miniatures around the playing surface and attacking their opponent's miniatures. Attacking is done by rolling dice and comparing the results to the defending player's dice roll. If the attacker's roll is higher, then the defending player's miniature is \"killed\" and removed from the playing surface. The game ends when one player either has no more miniatures, or concedes the game.",

            "answer": "Alright, here's how it goes:\n\nLikely, once friendly hellos are over, each side will bring over boxes or cases full of little cardboard or plasticard bits of terrain. they will find a nearby battlefield - really, just a big flat modified table thing on which they'll fight - and likely, they'll take turns putting down pieces of terrain until they're sure that it will be a fun match.\n\nAssuming it's a 1 on 1 fight, each side will bring an amount of little dudes and tanks appropriate to the fight they're having. They'll then put these little dudes and tanks on the table. How many guys start on the table, where they start on the table, and when they are allowed to come on is mainly decided by the deployment rules. there are couple of other things, but deployment rules are cricial to players deciding how they will play the game (for example: armies that really like shooting may prefer corner deployments because it dramatically increases the space between them and the other guy). There are also \"missions\" which determine whether the players win by killing the other guy's dudes, or holding ground, or whatever.\n\nIn the actual game, format is usually as follows:\n1. player one moves all his guys\n2. player one shoots\n3. player one \"assaults\" (i.e. has his dudes break out bayonettes and apparantly try to stab the other guy's dudes to death in a complicated hand-to-hand combat. This tends to be very all-or-nothing, and sucess is often decided by your ability to (get into these/avoid these) as much or as little as your army needs it. You **cannot** shoot into assault, so you better hope you can block an assault or that your guys die quickly if your army isn't good enough to just win these outright.\n\nthen player 2 moves, player 2 shoots, player 2 assaults...\n\nThis continues until turn 5, at which point, depending on dice rolls, the game either ends, or gets drag out another turn. on turn 6, they roll again, and either the game ends or it goes to turn 7. Turn 7 is as far as games can go normally. \n\nNow, I'm just trying to give a picture of the general flow of a game, without talking about more complicated ideas like leadership, or mechanization, or why you shouldn't play necrons, lol. \n\nAt the risk of being flamed, I idly suggest you check out [this guy](_URL_0_), as he has a really good grasp of the strategical nuances in the game (although he is something of a dick, or so I am told.)",

            "answer": "This is my completely unscientific guess as a medical student- open to corrections!\n\nWhen you stretch, you unconsciously perform something called a 'valsalva manoeuvre' against your epiglottis. This is when you kind of breath out but close your windpipe so that no air can get out. It turns out this has a number of effects, mostly on circulation. Your cardiac output decreases, causing your blood vessels to constrict and your heart to beat faster to bring output back up. This is why after you stretch you sometimes get a brief palpitation.\n\nThe main reason that you might want to perform a valsalva manoeuvre, is that stretching will automatically otherwise expel air in the lungs. Contracting the muscles around you chest squeezes you like a boa constrictor, and unless you put a lid on it, you'll lose the breath you took in.\n\nSo basically, I would say you block your airway to stop you from losing your breath, but you let it trickle out slowly possibly to prevent overtaxing your heart (doesn't make a big difference, but who knows whether it gave our ancestors an advantage). That trickling sounds like a weird stretch gurgle.\n\nEDIT: Or, now that I think of it, it could just be that your unconscious valsalva manoeuvre isn't strong enough to contain the air being expelled by your mighty chest muscles. Who knows.",

            "answer": "Your body uses sugar as its main form of energy. Your body gains energy from three main macronutrients: fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. These three can ultimately break down into sugars, or be stored and used for body mass.\n\nCarbohydrates are categorized into digestible and indigestible carbs. The indigestible carbs are fibers (also categorized as a complex carb; but fibers from vegetables mostly). Digestible carbs are complex carbohydrates (bread, wheat, etc) that break down into simple sugars, or simple sugars (plain sugar, fruit sugar, etc) themselves.\n\nFats are categorized as saturated, unsaturated, or trans. Trans take longest to process. Unsaturated take shortest. Saturated is inbetween.\n\nProteins are either used for muscle building or stored in fat for later use.\n\nCarbs are quick source of energy that fills up blood sugar levels. When you exercise, your body taps into blood sugars via glycolysis. When it runs out, you tap into fat reserves under ketosis. When you are at the point of starvation, you undergo catabolysis nd consume muscle tissue.\n\nIncreased heart rate does two things : exercises your heart, and increases your body's metabolism. Increased metabolism just means increased consumption of energy.\n\nWeight loss is simple : Burn more calories than you eat. Exercising makes you gain strength, which allows you to burn calories faster as you get stronger. So a good exercise routine would involve strength training to gain some muscle weight to better lose fat weight.\nYou should eat enough so that you aren't undergoing catabolysis and so that you maintain muscle weight.\nGood rule of thumb : reduce fats, count your carbs and proteins when you work out.\n\n Edit : adding stuff\n\nEdit: fixing semantics",

            "answer": "On a normal day, my chickens don't even notice... they lay their eggs in the nest box and then go back out to the run and forget about them. But periodically one will get \"broody\", meaning her mothering instincts kick in and she wants to sit on some eggs until they hatch. When this happens she'll become much more protective. She'll stay in the nest box most of the day, and the other hens will slip eggs under her so she'll care for them. When I go to take those eggs, she'll puff her feathers up to look bigger. She might peck at me when I take them. But once I've scooped them out she forgets about them almost instantly and just waits for new eggs to appear. Her instinct seems to be about protecting the space, not counting eggs.\n\nOnce she's sat on them for a week or so, though, she will become aware of their numbers. If I were to slip another egg under her then, she might try to knock it out of the nest. And once they hatch, I wouldn't be able to slip any other chicks in with her, unless one of her eggs hadn't hatched -- if she sat on 8 eggs, she'll want to raise 8 or fewer chicks and will reject any extras.",

Skyrim on the otherhand, does not really utilize the brain at all that much. All you are doing in skyrim is the same old practiced routines over and over again. Probably the first couple times of playing skyrim, you had trouble playing for 5 hours a day, until you practiced it enough to be easy. It's kind of like a baby walking. First couple of times, only 2 minutes a day. Now, you can walk for hours. Same stuff, just practiced until you aren't really thinking anymore.",

More like trying to focus light though a weirdly placed clear football than a clear marble.  So your total prescription needs more than one indicator to describe the shape.\n\nThe axis number is used to combine the previous two numbers, so your eyeglass lens+actual eye work together as if they were a single properly shaped eye.\n\nThe muscles around your eye can make his correction manually if it isn't too strong a prescription by making your eye the correct shape.  In general though, they get worse at doing so as you age, and get tired if you force that all the time.\n\nYou'd have trouble seeing far away objects even without the astigmatism, but yours is moderately strong.  From a practical standpoint, more astigmatism=more important to have someone well-trained help you pick, measure, and fit your glasses.  The lens alignment and position are more important than if you had only a -2.5 sphere measurement, for example.  So, yes, see a real professional.",

There is a huge difference if the mass is muscle mass or if it is fat. And it also depends what type of exercise it is. Someone with a lot of body weight will exercise certain muscles by just moving around but other muscles might not get any exercise. And if you talk about someone who are not doing regular exercises then a lot of the difference is in the technique and muscle control. Two people with similar body mass and body build might lift very different weights if you send them to the gym, but if they go to the gym several times a week then you will see a lot of improvement after just a few weeks and they start perform more similarly to each other. And that is before you see much impact on the muscle mass as it is all technique and muscle control.",

If someone has a really heavy body, it might be harder for them to lift something heavy because their body is already using a lot of energy just to move around. But if someone has a lighter body, it might be easier for them to lift something heavy because they have more energy to use just for lifting. Hope that helps!",

            "answer": "A decibel is a tenth of a Bel. Literally deci-Bel and is abbreviated dB.\n  \nA Bel is a unit of *relative* power. It is a ratio of the measured entity divided by a standard entity.  So it is a fraction.  If it is  & lt; 1, the measured entity is less than the standard, and so forth.  \n  \nBecause of the large differences in numbers (a millionth or a million times), it is expressed as a power of 10.  For example if something is a million times as powerful than the standard, it is 6 Bels, or 60 deci-Bels.  \n  \nSo if you have something smaller than the standard, the number is a negative power of 10.  Something a millionth of the standard would be -6 Bels, or -60 dB.  \n  \nSo, in electronics, where we want to measure how much noise is on a line compared to how much signal, you might see something on the order of -80 dB.  \n  \nIf you are measuring power, you will see -3 dB a lot, because it is half the power.  Log10(0.5) * 10 = approx -3.    \n  \nOne thing dB is used for is measuring sound pressure.  We base our sound pressure measurements on the minimum level of human perception of basically a mosquito 3m away, if you haven't been to too many rock concerts.  However, acoustic power varies by the ratio of the *square* of the pressure measurements, basically doubling the dB.",

Could someone take half a chicken? \n\nMoney gets rid of these problems though. If I have a chicken and want some apples, I can sell my chicken to *anyone* who wants a chicken, take the money they give me, and then give that to anyone who has apples.

This is because of the historical precedent set by previous generations of workers; men have typically been paid more than women for the same job. Therefore, companies believe that they can get away with paying women less, because they think that women will accept lower wages. Additionally, there are often fewer women than men who are qualified for certain jobs, so companies may feel like they have to pay men more in order to attract and retain the best employees.",

Meanwhile, the brain is the color it is because the neurons are grayish and the fatty insulation is whitish. Finally, muscle can actually vary in color depending on what type it is. Slow twitch has a lot of capillaries as well as mitochondria and myoglobin, giving it a nice deep red color. Fast twitch has the least mitochondria and myoglobin, making it a paler color. \n\nMany other examples of organs exist, but they certainly aren't as color coded as anatomy textbooks make them appear.",

            "answer": "So for water to turn from liquid to gas it needs to be at a certain temperature (usually 100C) and then it needs to absorb enough energy to transition from liquid to gas, this is called Latent Engergy of Vaporization. This is why water \"boils\", because the pot of water may be at 100C but as some of the water absorbs enough energy to turn to gas it bubbles up through the rest of the water. The amount of energy for water at 100C to turn from liquid to gas is about 100 time more energy than to heat the water from room temperature to 100C. This is why only small parts of the water turn into gas at a time.\n\nYou can \"flash boil\" water, where it would all vaporize at once. To do this you would have to heat the water under enough pressure to raise the boiling point high enough that you could get enough energy into the water that once the pressure is released and the boiling point drops it all instantly boils. Though this would be extremely dangerous, because that would essentially be a bomb.\n\nA better example is \"flash freezing\". Where water is super-cooled then with a single tap it all turns to ice in a second. Look up videos of that.",

            "answer": "It's a bit complicated for a five year old, but see how you do.\n\nMetabolism is how your body converts food into energy. There are three main ways to store this energy:\n\nInside muscle cells: when you see a bear, he isn't going to give you a 5 minute stretch and 10 minute walking warm up, you gotta run right now. This is only used in emergencies and is incredibly inefficient.\n\nInside the liver: this is your generic energy store, takes a while to get into action, but is very efficient.\n\nInside fat cells: this is a super efficient long term storage that is used very slowly.\n\nWhen you eat food, the energy is allocated in roughly this order: your emergency muscle storage is filled up first, then your liver storage, then your fat cells, then if you have extra, your fat cells will duplicate.\n\nIf you are thinking about diets and losing fat, certain foods (specifically sugar), can very quickly fill up your muscle and liver stores, and also create a situation where there is too much glucose (energy) in your bloodstream. Your muscle cells will reduce their ability to take in glucose to protect themselves, which will make nearly all of your energy enter your fat cells, filling and duplicating them (making more fat). Too much of this leads to fat gain, and possibly diabetes. To reverse this process you have to trick your body into using your emergency muscle stores which will make new energy go to muscles and the liver, instead of straight to fat.\n\nSome ways to do this are:\n\n* Running for your life from a bear.\n\n* Doing high intensity weights\n\n* Sprinting",

What you perceive from your senses is processed in your short term memory and is eventually shuffled off to long term memory when the brain no longer deems it useful for the current time. Deja Vu occurs when the signals to your short term memory either go to long term memory first or ends up in both at the same time. Seeing the sensory input in both the short term and long term memory confuses the brain into thinking that it has experienced the event in the past and at the current time creating the feeling that you have experienced before. \n\nSince it occurs when something goes wrong in the brain anyone who gets it on a daily basis should seriously see a neurologist on that.",

            "answer": "If a fire were to break out on a spacecraft in orbit, astronauts would fight the flames in slightly different ways than they would on Earth. Fires in space are not the same as fires on Earth, but the best way to fight any fire is to keep it from starting.\n\nAs hot gasses from a flame rise, they create air currents that bring fresh air to the fire. This buoyancy is what makes a flame long and pointed here on Earth. In low gravity situations, there is no buoyancy from flames.Convection, the movement of air, is an important way that heat is transferred to other spaces. Without air, fires don't spread as rapidly. Ventilation fans on the Space Station replace natural convection and can supply the air a fire needs to burn. Under these circumstances, the fire can spread in any direction, rather than just upward.\n\nThe flame's unusual shape creates different amounts of soot, smoke or harmful gases. \"Combustion in microgravity is a very difficult problem, and there are a lot of engineers and scientists working to understand it better,\" said Gary A. Ruff, aerospace engineer at Glenn Research Center's Microgravity Combustion Science Branch in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nAll materials going up into space are tested for flammability on Earth in a special test chamber and ignited with a hot wire. Some items are so important to a mission's success that they're permitted to travel to space despite being flammable.\n\nDetecting a fire in space is also different than on Earth. Here, smoke detectors are installed on the ceiling or upper section of a wall because that's the direction in which smoke travels. In space, smoke doesn't rise, so detectors on International Space Station are placed within the ventilation system.\nWhile the ISS hasn't experienced a fire, a significant blaze did take place in 1997 on the Russian Space Station Mir. The fire came from an oxygen generator, where the oxygen supplied a ready source of fuel. Tests showed that the generator had to run out of oxygen for the fire to burn out. If a fire were to occur on the ISS, the astronauts would become firemen and follow a three-step response system.\n\nFirst, they would turn off the ventilation system to slow the spread of fire. Next they would shut off power to the effected unit. Finally astronauts would use fire extinguishers to put out the flames.\n\nRuff says that while safeguards have been in place to prevent a fire from occurring on the Space Station, it's comforting to know that astronauts could respond to an emergency because they've prepared for any eventuality.",

            "answer": "If you approach this problem from a clean slate this can be answered rather simply. Lets presume you live to be 80 years old and we start this at the age of 20.\n\nThat is sixty years of life you gotta cover.\n\nShort answer would be around 1,000,000 dollars if you live in the USA\nSimply by living off the interest of this amount sitting in a bank would allow you to afford a very meager lifestyle, and towards the end of your life you could cash it in and spend the rest of it. Invested properly this could get you from 10,000 a year to 50,000 (the latter involving dividends and the prior sticking it into a savings account)\n\nYou have no assets, no car, no home, nothing. Starting here we need to understand what you want out of life. To simply survive, you only need around what food costs you a year, but then you'll be homeless- and probably won't make it to 80.\n\nTo have a property- depends greatly on where you live, but you need to pay an upkeep to keep your property (Taxes, fixing problems, replacing broken things) so we can take a stab at this- or you can go the route of renting which will be \"Cheaper\" but you will never be able to get the money back, where by owning a property eventually you pay it off and can resell it if you desire.\n\nThe reason people like to own a property is because as long as the value remains steady it essentially costs you \"Nothing\" outside of taxes/upkeep. If you live in it for 20 years and sell it for what you bought it for, you just lived in a house for \"Free\" \n\nWe will call the property 150,000 + 200,000 in costs over your life if you don't sell it and live there all 60 years. This is a tiny house for one person. If you live in NY, I'm sorry but the 200,000 just turned into 600,000 but lets just pray you don't.\n\nCost of living, in the USA you need a car unless you live in a city- but lets pray you don't because cities are stupid expensive. Car lasts 10 years (rough estimate) costs 20,000. 20,000 x 6 = 120,000\n\nUpkeep on car + Gas + Costs of living = 10,000 a year as long as you don't travel much/keep the car in good condition/don't eat out every day\n\nTOTAL IT OUT: \n\n* Small cheap home/costs of renting for 60 years: 350,000 $ (If you buy, you can get a lot of this back when you decide to sell and move which makes this an interesting category as the house can essentially cost you nothing, and just act as a bank account you can't touch until you move.)\n\n* Costs of cars at a 10 year life span: 120,000 $\n\n* Costs of living/utilities/insurance over 60 years: 600,000 $\n\n* Extra stuff/things I've missed: 100,000 $\n\nThis is not counting the money you will make off of interest, and state by state the taxes will be different so the costs of living could fluctuate dramatically depending.\n\nIf you took this as a magical lump some in a savings account and somehow avoided getting the shit taxed out of it you could live off the interest and be extremely poor- or invest it and live well enough off of dividends. This is a difficult question to answer due to the fact that currency- especially the dollar, might not hold over the next 60 years. I also don't know how \"rich\" you want to live.\n\nThe long and short of it though: 1.1 million $ to live as \"Lower-middle class\" and taking it as a given that it is simply just you and not a family",
