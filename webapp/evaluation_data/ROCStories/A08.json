The sentences are short and simple, and there is not much description or action to draw the reader in.

Additionally, the ending sentence, \"She was sad when her vacation was over,\" is a bit abrupt and could benefit from more reflection or emotion from Annie. Overall, the story is pleasant but could use more depth and excitement to fully engage the reader.",
