#                   "A study from San Diego State University. In a controlled setting, researchers found that drinking two cans of regular Coca-Cola every day for three days caused people to consume almost 300 extra calories above their normal daily intake without significantly affecting how much they weighed.[2] At this point it‚Äôs important you don't get too excited about Coke and start stockpiling the pantry with them; while hundreds or even thousands might not seem like such an awful lot at first glance (hey‚Äîit is just 3 sodas right?) these small increases add up quick if consumed regularly over time! In fact those few soft drinks do more than simply affect your body's calorie consumption: They also contain loads on sugar[3], which as we know by now has been identified as one major factor contributing obesity in America today![4]. So instead think twice before reaching into any pop machines near work when looking around lunchtime ‚Äì doing so once may be no big deal but after years spent slowly consuming excess amounts each year keep pilling onto our waistlines regardless where being overweight really hurts us most...right under chin.",

Reddit itself will probably not change much, as it's an aggregation of content from elsewhere, but all those sites that are linked are going to need more bandwidth. In order to cope with the increased demands, ISPs will be prompted to improve their service.  However... they don\'t NEED to.  Their audience needs their product and there isn\'t another option outside the big boys.  So what they\'ll likely do is increase the service *for those who pay for preferential treatment*.
